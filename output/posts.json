[{"title":"Fr. Ignatius Spencer","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 21st January 2018","","","","Fr. Ignatius Spencer looks like Churchill in a Passionist habit and, to my shame, I never took much interest in him – except to surprise people by telling them he was the great, great, great uncle of Princess Diana. He was also a great uncle of Winston Churchill. But it just shows how wrong and foolish we can be when we assess people by their looks       \nor where they come from. Recently I’ve come to appreciate this good and holy man who courageously faced decisions I’ve never had to face in my life. And it is this one aspect I want to look at here.","He was ordained as an Anglican clergyman in June,1824 and his father, Lord Spencer, had provided handsomely for him by making him vicar of Great Brington. He took his ministry very seriously and, in the course of it, met a shy young Catholic priest called Fr. Foley and an enthusiastic young convert to Catholicism called Ambrose Phillipps. Through discussions with these and other contacts, George Spencer (as he was then) gradually became convinced of the truth of the Catholic position. Afterwards he said, “I now openly declared myself completely shaken, and, though I determined to take no decided step until I was satisfied, I had little doubt what the result would be.” Shortly after this, he told Phillipps, “I am overcome. There is no doubt of the truth. One more Sunday I will preach to my congregation and then put myself into Fr. Foley’s hands, and conclude this business.” Yet, even before they parted, he felt that this last appearance as an Anglican clergyman would compromise his conscience. Had he any right, he asked himself, “to stand in that pulpit, being convinced that the church to which it belongs is heretical?” After further reflection, he finally decided: “If this step is right for me to take next week, it is my duty to take it now. Tomorrow I will be received into the Church.” That evening they sent a message to Lord Spencer to tell him that he would give up the living of Great Brington. Part of George’s struggle and anguish in making this decision was knowing very well the impact it would have on his parents and family. There was even the fear that the news might endanger his father’s life. But he trusted that since he had taken the Lord’s words seriously about not letting love of father or mother or anyone else come between him and following Jesus, that Jesus would in turn comfort and support his parents and family. His father did in time show his understanding and forgiveness by making him a personal allowance because he had said ‘goodbye’ to £3,000 a year by his decision to become a Catholic. Still, his decision cast a gloom over the whole family at Althorp. Later his sister wrote to a friend, “My poor dear brother! What shall I say of him? I mean George, who has become a Catholic and we fear, a Catholic priest.” I wonder what she said when he went further and became a Passionist?","I feel his conversion story helps us understand those seeming harsh words of Jesus about not letting any other love get in the way of following him."]},{"title":"Wanting to be Great","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 30th June 2019","","","Trump wants America to be great again. How often have we heard that?  Muhammed Ali thought he was the greatest. And even Jesus’ first disciples were competing and arguing among themselves about which of them was the greatest! In today’s gospel when the people in a Samaritan village refuse to receive them, James and John also seem to have a Trump solution: “Lord do you want us to call down fire from heaven to burn them up?”","You remember Val Doonican, the very popular singer from Waterford? He once told a story about his Dad that I never forgot. When he was a young lad of seven or eight, he was called to his father’s bedside in the hospital. And his father said to him, “You know I’m going to die, don’t you?” “Yes” said the young lad, “Mammy told me.” “And you think I’m a great fellow, don’t you?”. “Yes”, said Val without any hesitation.","“Well”, said his father, “I want to tell you that I’m not the great fella you think I am. I drank too much, and I’ve messed up my life in many ways. And I won’t be long dead before people start telling you your father was no good, and I just want you to be able to tell them, “Yes, I know, he told me himself.”","Val’s father didn’t think he was great at all, and yet he was great in what matters most. Even though sick and weak, he thought of the hurt the little lad would experience when he began to hear all the stories about his Dad and he gave him a way of dealing with it, “Yes, I know, he told me himself!”","Jesus summed up what is really great in life when he said, “Always treat others as you would like them to treat you; that is the meaning of the Law and the Prophets.”","You remember, too, that one day he asked his disciples, “What were you arguing about on the road?” And they said nothing because they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest. They obviously had some understanding that their arguing and motivation were all wrong, which is why they said nothing!","It’s also good and necessary for us to ask ourselves what is motivating us in all that we do and say. What kind of greatness are we after?","","Hope you enjoy a great summer break!","","","","","","","","","","",""]},{"title":"A prescence that’s real","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 23rd June 2019","","","","We talk about Jesus’ presence with us and we call it a ‘real’ presence. It is not imaginary; it is a real meeting, a real contact, life flowing one to another. And we do long for real presence, don’t we? And it doesn’t happen all that often. As Jean Vanier says, “We can live in the same house, sit at the same table, kneel in the same pew, read the same books but never meet.” Never really meet! Real presence with Jesus should prepare us for real presence with others.","","At Hindu temples in India they tell you, “You come here not to gaze at God but to let God gaze at you.”  We have the same thing in the psalms: “Let your face shine on us and we will be saved.”  And “The Lord takes delight in his people.”  I love the story about a mother who took delight in her little daughter in Trinidad. They are very poor, but the mother takes great care each evening to launder the one well-worn dress that her daughter wears to school each day. Each morning, as the little girl leaves, her mother asks her to stop and turn towards her for a moment. “Just stand there. I love looking at you.” And I told you before about the father who looked at his little girl and said, “When you grow up, you’ll wheel barrows of sunshine into dark places.” It was all the more extraordinary and powerful, because he never said that much. And she certainly has done what he said!","","When God, or anyone, beams on you, it makes it that much easier to go forth and spread that positive gaze. Doesn’t It? Consciously coming into the presence of God or Jesus should be something like that.  At Mass or Adoration, it may help to imagine God or Jesus shining on you like the sun. The golden rays of the Monstrance seem to suggest this.  We can sit before Jesus who smiles on us, who fully accepts us. We don’t have to say much. It means we can be happy to be there, really there, in that one place. Not all over the place as we often are!","","You remember the story of St. John Vianney, the Cure of Ars, who asked an old man, who was always praying in in the church, how did he manage to pray so much? And the old man replied:","","“It’s easy; I just look at him and he looks at me”!","","","","","","","","","","",""]},{"title":"God rejoices in intimacy","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 16th June 2019","","","","The Mystery of the Trinity is the mystery of a God who does not live in splendid isolation but a God who rejoices eternally in intimacy. This week I share with you this shortened version of an article by scripture scholar,  Dorothy Lee:","Why do I stay in the church when most of my mid-life contemporaries have long since left? When my friends tell me it’s dangerous for my health and happiness? When my teenage daughter – like many of her friends – finds it dull, misogynist, unrelated to real life?","I stay in a place that undeniably gives me heartache. Women denied selfhood and autonomy. Gay friends denied the sacraments, ministry and priesthood. A church governed by rules and regulations that are grim and life denying.","All the same I stay.  Not because I’m a hero. I stay because the same church, which denies life, also holds in its hands a radical gospel that is more life enhancing than any of the packaged goods I see on religious supermarket shelves. I stay because the church tells me that, as God became human, so I too will become divine. It proclaims that my bodily life in all its messiness is part of the being of God, since God has become bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh. It teaches that my relationships are meaningful because they mirror a God who rejoices eternally in intimacy. I stay because the church reassures me that I belong to a community without limits in space and time, at one with all creatures, living and dead. It shows me how I am part of creation’s journey towards God. It makes sense of my pain, setting human suffering in the hopeful frame of Christ’s passion, death and resurrection.","I stay because, as a biblical scholar, I am part of a community that is re-reading ancient texts in new and exciting ways. I love the Bible – in all its beauty and terror, its craziness and depth. The bible shows me what it means to be human, to be in community with others, to be in harmony with the earth, to be in a relationship with God.","I stay in the church because when I fall in my life there are hands held out to lift me up, to hold me, to forgive and accept me. Dreadful though church leaders and teachers can sometimes be, they can’t hide the treasures of the gospel. Nor can they eradicate the traces of courageous women who lived and loved within and beyond the boundaries of the church.","I stay to be at the feet of such grace and spirit. I stay for those who have shown me grace. I stay for those who need grace – especially the young people whose lives offer them everything but meaning, every novelty of a consumerist world except the exhilaration of knowing and being known by God.","","","","","","","","","","","",""]},{"title":"Pentecost Sunday","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 9th June 2019","","","There’s a lovely simple story about a young ocean fish swimming around everywhere, looking for the ocean. He consults an older, more experienced fish who is very surprised and says, “But this is the ocean, you’re in it, it’s all around you, you couldn’t live without it!” The young fish is very disappointed and says, “No, this is just water, I’m looking for the ocean!” And off he scurries, still looking for the ocean","Just as the fish is in the ocean and needs the ocean to survive, so are we in God. St. Paul says, “In him we live and move and have our being”. We could say, “In him we swim!” But when we try to talk about God or God’s spirit, our words and images are all inadequate and limping. At the same time, some are better than others.","At one time, I imagined God’s spirit inside me, safely locked inside me like Jesus in the tabernacle. The gospel does speak about God coming and making his home with us, and about God’s spirit being poured into us! But that sounds like I have God’s spirit instead of God’s spirit having me! Which is very different! And carrying me off in new and unfamiliar ways! This is a far better image. We are in God and the air all around us is our ocean in which we live and move and have our being.","That’s why the air, the wind, is a great symbol of God’s spirit as well as fire and water and these are all sources of energy and power. But let’s stay with the image of wind today. Everywhere now on our mountains, there are turbines harnessing the power of the wind. And, if I may brag a little, long before there were wind turbines on the mountains; long ago at home, when we were children, we were the first in our area to have electricity. And why? Because my father set up our own wind turbine in the back garden. We called it a ‘wind charger’ and when the wind was strong, we had great light and energy but when the wind was weak, we had to go back to the oil lamps!","With God’s spirit, we never have that problem; the power is constant, always strong. The only problem is how we harness this energy. As believers, we know and believe that power is there for us, but we must want it, plug into it and positively claim it day after day. The sacraments are one way we link into this power. Prayer is another, a prayer of gratitude that we can breathe deeply of God’s Spirit.","So, let’s pray, this Pentecost day, that the Spirit may come and instruct our hearts and remind us of all that Jesus has promised.","","","","","","","","","","","",""]},{"title":"Being Carried Up To Heaven","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 2nd June 2019","","","Jesus talked about the Good Shepherd carrying the lost sheep home on his shoulders. We love that image, don’t we? In St. Luke’s gospel, the Ascension is described as Jesus being “carried up to heaven” And where he has gone, we hope to be carried too. Don’t we?  And still, there’s something about all this carrying that I’m uneasy about. And I don’t know why! What is it about ‘being carried’ that touches such deep feelings within us? Is it that coming into life we were carried for nine long months in our mother’s womb? Or have we memories of hearing that someone ‘had to be carried home’? Or do we dread the day we will no longer be independent or mobile – and need to be carried?","I remember, as a child, being carried on the bar of my father’s bicycle, how often I don’t know, but I know it left deep impressions and feelings that I carry to this day. I remember being surrounded by his warmth and energy; I remember feeling so safe and secure and, strange though this seems, I remember being aware of the extra effort and energy expended on me, small though I was! And I felt guilty about that.","Much later in life, I read how Pope John XX111, when carried into St. Peter’s on his big chair, remembered how, as a child, he was once carried on his father’s shoulders at some religious ceremony and this led him to say, “The secret of everything is to allow the Lord to carry us and to carry the Lord to others.”","‘To be carried’ sounds easy and attractive, doesn’t it? You don’t have to do anything – just allow yourself to be carried! But it’s not one bit easy; it takes great trust; it’s like lying back on the ocean and trusting you won’t drown! It means trusting you’ll be carried to a good place. Even as a child on the bar of the bike, part of me wanted to be doing the cycling myself instead of being carried! And I think for many of us, it is far easier to carry than to be carried; we were trained more in giving than in receiving. It was said about one of our priests that if he went out after the lost sheep, he’d only bring the sheep halfway home!” And why? Because he loved saving the lost sheep and if he brought the lost one home, he’d be out of a job!  Maybe we love the Good Shepherd image because we fancy ourselves in the Jesus role and forget we are more often the lost one in need of help!","Maybe that’s why we almost need to experience our weakness and frailty before we allow God, or anyone, to help us or carry us home.","","Yes, it’s great and good to give and to carry but it’s also so necessary to graciously accept the help we need and allow ourselves to be carried.","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""]},{"title":"Spiritual pain","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 26th May 2019","","","","Medical science has come a long way in helping to control bodily pain. But there is a deeper, more intimate pain that is not easy to deal with. Words are helpful to describe bodily pain but spiritual or soul pain is not so easy to describe. Each of us has so much in us that transcends us. The mighty ship that sails the ocean seems to move serenely but only because of that part which is under the surface. It is in that hidden place that the power to move lies. With us, it’s similar. It is in our hidden selves, in our soul, that we tick, and it is there that we really hurt. And that part of us is as much a mystery to us as it is to those with whom we live and work. Because of that, speaking to someone in soul pain is scary, sensitive, unknown territory. There are no clear directions. There are no easy answers, no ready – made remedies and above all, no right of admission to that inner, sacred place unless invited there.","The only response must be one of reverent silence and total attentiveness. It must be a listening with the heart, with deep love, respect and above all, compassion. So often, we listen with the head – judgemental, critical and analytical. Or we listen to try to understand the other person, but even that can get in the way. And it is so easy for us to project on the other person something of our own experience. We need to be patient and allow them to be themselves. We need to realise that the pain is probably not limited to the present but also reaches back to past years.","So, all we can do is to listen with a heart full of compassion – to attempt, with the other’s permission, to walk the road of pain with them, listening to what is being said and to what cannot be said. Being with people in spiritual pain, we often feel helpless and, of course, don’t like feeling like that. We want to help; we may even expect ourselves to find a solution. But what we need to learn, slowly and painfully, is that we can’t fix people like we fix cars! People are far more complex, layers of flesh and spirit and all shrouded in mystery.","People are longing to be listened to, longing to be taken seriously, longing to be accepted just as they are. They are not looking for cheap advice; they do not expect us to solve their problems; they just want to be listened to; they want to be heard and in that reverent listening, a loosening of fixed attitudes can occur. And in that, God’s spirit can get through to relieve the pain and bring what Jesus calls ‘rest for our souls’.","","","","","","","","","","","",""]},{"title":"To be taken seriously","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 19th May 2019","","","","I was giving a mission in St.Eugene’s Cathedral in Derry sometime during the troubles, and after the night session, the local priests encouraged the people to go home quietly and to ignore the soldiers.  At the back of the Cathedral as people were leaving, I heard one woman say to another, “Don’t even bother to ignore them!” As if to ignore them was giving them far too much attention! So, it’s a very good sign when we interact with people and feel free to agree or disagree with them.  It means we take them seriously!","And after we are fed, clothed and sheltered, to be taken seriously is probably our most basic human need. You’d wonder why naggers keep on nagging when it never seems to work. But it’s probably a desperate cry from the heart to be heard and to be taken seriously. People looking for jobs are so often frustrated for the same reason. One man put it very well when he said, “The worst part in applying for jobs is getting no reply, as though I don’t exist!”  That describes the feeling! And I always find it hard to read aloud in church that Jesus fed five thousand men, “not counting women and children”! The ‘not counting’ has been going on for a very long time! Women and children had to scream to be heard. And many feel women are still not being heard or taken seriously in the church.","When we are not taken seriously, there’s a great danger we will be driven to taking ourselves too seriously. If other people don’t take me seriously, I’ll have to do the job for myself! From there, it’s a very small step to self – importance and constant bragging that drives away the very people you hoped might believe in you and take you seriously. It took me a long time to see that the people who seem ‘full of themselves’ and are constantly lecturing and seeking attention are not self – confident at all. They are full of insecurity and doubt and in need of constant boosting. So insatiable is this need, they are not easy to live with or work with. Needless to say, we all have a need to feel appreciated or, at the very least, to be taken seriously. It is like spiritual fuel and energy. But taking oneself too seriously is like a poison.","","While we need people to appreciate us, we also need people to tell us when to lighten up!","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""]},{"title":"Fr. Patrick Peyton (1909-1992)","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 12th May 2019","","","St. Charles was beatified by Pope John Paul way back in October,1988. On my way home at Rome airport, I had just sat down having bought my duty free (including some whiskey – for my mother, of course!), when along came Fr. Peyton, the world famous ‘Rosary Priest’ and sat down beside me and we had a great chat. I told him I had been twice on missions in his home parish of Attymas in Mayo. And he told me that when he was a young lad at home, he had thought of joining us, the Passionists. But that he was put off when two of our men on a parish mission preached such terrifying sermons condemning the drink that the people brought in their stills from the hills around and battered them in bits in the chapel yard! And he was a pioneer, he said, from that day to this! When I heard this, I pushed my duty free a little further under the seat and tried to change the subject to the Pope! He’d just been to see the Pope for a whole hour. What could you talk about for a whole hour, I wondered?  He said all the Pope wanted to know about was this: what life was like at home in Ireland when he was growing up. What his father was like? What his mother was like? And, of course, they were both old enough and wise enough to know that there’s nothing more important than where you come from and the family that reared you.","When we look at Jesus, we see the rearing of the home in Nazareth. When we see his great compassion to the outcast and the sinner, his tolerance towards other races and religions, his courage in condemning any kind of hypocrisy in religion or injustice in politics, it’s good to remember he learned all that in a human way at home and especially from Mary. From her too, he learned his humble trusting attitude towards God his Father. That’s what was outstanding in Jesus and that’s also what Elizabeth praises above all else in Mary: “Blessed is she who believed/trusted that the promise made her by the Lord would be fulfilled.”","Fr Peyton, whose famous rallying call was “The family that prays together stays together”, staged massive Rosary rallies all over the world. In December 2017, in recognition of his “heroic virtue” Fr Peyton was named Venerable by Pope Francis, a step on the way to Beatification.","Little did I think, as I returned from the Beatification of Charles, that the man I enjoyed talking to at the Airport would himself be one day lined up for Beatification!","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""]},{"title":"Jesus cooks Breakfast","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 5th May 2019","","","","Today Jesus cooks breakfast. I’m sure he often did. It’s just that today we hear about it. Without him, the apostles were at a loose end. They decided to go back to what they knew something about – fishing! But they weren’t great at that either. All night they caught nothing. Jesus, standing by the shore in the early morning light, could see where the fish were. Apparently to this day, it is easier to see where the fish are from the shore than from the boat! So following his directions, they catch so many fish they can’t haul the net in. It’s only then they recognise it’s Jesus and, as they come closer to shore, they see he has a fire burning and he has bread and he’s cooking fish. Was he doing some fishing of his own? Jesus says, “Bring some of the fish you’ve just  caught.” And Peter went aboard and dragged the net to the shore full of big fish; and despite there’re being so many, the net was not broken. And Jesus said, “Come and have breakfast.”","What a happy breakfast that must have been! The toasted bread and the fresh fish would have been delicious after the long night. What did they have to drink? The gospel doesn’t say. No doubt they were drinking in the whole wonder of having Jesus with them again, looking at the wounds in his hands and feet, noticing how he’s the same Jesus they knew so well and yet he’s different; wondering is he angry with them for their cowardice and betrayal. Yet, he’s cooking breakfast for them! He’s the same thoughtful, practical, loving man he was before. Before? They don’t want to think about before! But it’s almost as if nothing had happened; maybe the breakfast is Jesus’ way of saying, “It’s o.k. I understand you; you like to think you’re strong and tough but no one’s that tough when it comes to it! You know that now and that’s great learning. From now on you’ll know it’s not a problem to be weak and flawed. Maybe you didn’t realise it up to now. My Father can use you best when you don’t let your imagined strength or intelligence get in the way; when you realise your weakness does not disqualify you either. If it did, there would be no one in the Kingdom of God!”","We are all struggling towards the great Christian ideals. We should know now, if we didn’t before, that the church is not an exclusive, perfect society. We have mighty ideals but each of us is a work in progress and always will be. Being inclusive doesn’t mean lowering those ideals but it means welcoming people where they are! Part of people’s anger with the church is that they were made to feel unworthy and unwanted; they were met with rules and rigidity rather than with understanding and compassion.","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""]},{"title":"Help my unbelief","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 28th April 2019","","","","Faith in the Resurrection of Jesus, as we know, is at the heart of Christian faith. Yet we often struggle with doubts, don’t we?  Even though, according to St. Paul, without the resurrection of Jesus, everything else collapses.  St. Paul knew it wasn’t easy to believe. That’s why he said, “If Christ be not raised, we are of all people most to be pitied!”","I know I mentioned Thomas, ‘doubting’ Thomas last week but there’s so much we can learn from him. That’s why he gets a starring role and more talking parts in John’s gospel than in the other gospels.  And all because John also knew that believing in the bodily resurrection of Jesus was always going to be difficult for believers. It was difficult even for those who saw him after the resurrection. So, no wonder it’s difficult for us. And, as I said last week, Thomas wasn’t the only one who doubted. He was just more honest and blunt about it: “Unless I see the holes that the nails made in his hands and can put my finger into the holes they made, and unless I can put my hand into his side, I refuse to believe.”","Part of his problem, of course, was that he ‘wasn’t with the others when Jesus came.’  He felt let down by all that had happened. The great hopes they had, all dashed! But most of them stayed together. They gathered with Mary and supported one another in their grief. We, today, still need that same faith support. We need to gather together at least once a week to remember Jesus and his word.","The next time Jesus appears among them, Thomas is there. And Jesus takes him so gently. He doesn’t scold him or blame him for his lack of faith. He knows they’ve never experienced anything like this before, so he quietly says, “Thomas, give me your hand; examine my hands and feet; examine my side too. Doubt no longer but believe.”","Jesus is saying the same to us today, “Give me your hand, I will walk the way with you, I know it’s not easy for you. No life is easy. But I will be with you every step of the way.  I know you want to be able to understand all this. But you can’t.  It’s impossible. It’s too much for any human mind. Neither can you live a life of faith without me. But don’t be afraid. I will be with you. Blessed are you who cannot see and yet believe.”","It was said of the first believers that their joy was so great they couldn’t believe it! We can be like that. We won’t let ourselves believe in case we’ll be let down. We hold back!  Don’t hope for much and you won’t be disappointed! That kind of thing.  I’ve had to take myself in hand many times through life and scold myself, “For God’s sake and your own, stop thinking that reading, study and analysing will answer all your questions. Why can’t you just trust Jesus? Jesus can’t deceive us; Jesus won’t deceive us.  Help me pray with the father of the young boy in the gospel (Mark 9:24):","","“Lord, I do believe, help my unbelief.”","","","","","","","","","","",""]},{"title":"Easter Joy","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 21st April 2019","","","","As you know, there are so many symbols of Easter – the Easter fire and water and  candle, the empty tomb, the butterfly and many more. But, according to the liturgical experts, the greatest symbol of Easter is not any of these. No, it’s the weekly gathering of believers. We are the greatest symbol of Easter when we gather together to remember the risen Lord. But Pope Benedict added another symbol that I hadn’t heard of before – Easter Laughter!  He said that in the Baroque period (1600 – 1750 approx.) the Easter homilies had to contain a story which would make people laugh, so that the church resounded with joyful laughter. And Pope Benedict thought it right that joyful laughter become yet another symbol of Easter.It was meant to remind us of the deep genuine joy that should flow from our faith and hope in the Risen Lord.","Pope Benedict also said, ‘that the cultural context where faith was largely accepted has now disappeared for many, resulting in a profound crisis of faith.’  We’re certainly aware of that, but it’s interesting that the great Thomas Aquinas said that faith comes through feelings and through a sense of wonder just as much as through head knowledge or the study of Theology. It is about that, of course, but much more, it’s about relationship with Jesus and with others. Heart contact with Jesus and others!  Faith, as you know too, is not easy for anyone – not even the greatest saints! Nor was it easy for those who saw Jesus after his resurrection. We hear in the gospel that “their joy was so great they couldn’t believe it!” And remember Thomas. He wasn’t the only one who doubted.  But his great mistake was that,“He wasn’t with the others when Jesus came.”  The others were in mourning too, but they stuck together, remembering Jesus, recalling his words, supporting one another, where as Thomas was away, drowning his sorrows alone. For us too, the people with whom we gather for prayer and Eucharist are so important. We meet Jesus in the gathering of believers, where we are nourished by his presence and his word.  And when we gather, it’s good to remember we’re simply responding to his invitation to do this in his memory.","We thank God today for the great gift of faith and hope and the joy of our faith."]},{"title":"The Lamb of God","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 14th April 2019","","","All in the April evening","April airs were abroad;","I saw the sheep with their lambs","And thought of the Lamb of God.","These are the last lines of the well – known poem written by Katherine Tynan who was born at Whitehall Dairy Farm in Clondalkin in 1861.","Some years ago, my nephew, Dermot, who grew up in Georgia in the States, took Aimee, his wife, on a tour of Ireland. It must have been this time of year because Aimee fell in love with the sheep and the lambs all over the country and took hundreds of photos of them! When they arrived at Granny’s in Trim, Granny had a big pot of tea ready and a huge plate of sandwiches. They were really enjoying the sandwiches when American Aimee asked casually, “What kind of sandwiches are these?”  When Granny said “Lamb – lamb sandwiches!” poor Aimee nearly got sick! She couldn’t cope with the thought of eating those beautiful gentle creatures!","When John the Baptist pointed to Jesus and said, “Look, there is the Lamb of God!” he was thinking of all the lambs sacrificed in the temple every day and especially at the Pasch – sacrificed and eaten! So, he’s really saying, “Look, there is the lamb to be sacrificed for us in the future!”","When Jesus at the Last Supper says, “This is my body given for you, this is my blood poured out for you,” we should feel a thousand times more disturbed than Aimee was at the thought of eating the lamb sandwiches! I can’t take this! This is too much! It’s just that we’re so used to the invitation during mass to eat the Lamb of God: “Behold the Lamb of God… Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb.” It doesn’t disturb us in the same way that it confused and disturbed the first disciples.","With Jesus, of course, it’s a completely different kind of eating. There are no human words that can explain it. When we eat a lamb sandwich, it becomes part of us but when we eat the Lamb of God, we become part of God. We become part of the mystery that God is! During this Holy Week, let’s make time to reflect again on the wonder of all this and to praise and thank God for the great gift of faith and hope. It’s all summed up in the words we say at every mass when the drop of water is drowned in the wine:","By the mystery of this water and wine, may we come to share in the divinity of Christ who humbled himself to share in our humanity",""]},{"title":"Different ways of looking","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 7th April 2019","","","Jesus was teaching at daybreak – so early! And a big crowd had gathered to hear him. We’ll never know what Jesus intended to speak about that morning because the Scribes and Pharisees arrived dragging a woman caught in the very act of adultery. How did they know? Were they spying on her? And where was her partner in adultery?","Whatever about the rights and wrongs of it, it provided a lesson that the people gathered at daybreak would never forget. It was well worth getting up early for this! And this lesson was all about eyes and looking and different ways of looking:","When Jesus doesn’t immediately respond to their questions, they “persist” with their shouting, “What are we to do? Are we to stone her? It’s the law, isn’t it? Tell us what to do, compassionate Jesus!” But Jesus says nothing. It’s almost as if he wants them to hear themselves.","Finally, he does look up and when Jesus looks at you, he looks at you! He looks at them one by one and says: “If there is anyone among you who has not sinned, let him be the first to throw a stone at her,”","Now all eyes are on them:","This is different. It was fine when they were looking and pointing the finger and shouting. Now all eyes are on them and they can’t stand it. They drop their stones and slink away. And Jesus is left alone with the woman. Of course, they’re not alone. The crowd is still there watching, looking and learning!","Jesus looks up and says, “Where are they? Has anyone condemned you?” And she says, “No one, sir.” “Neither do I,” says Jesus, “go and don’t sin anymore.”","What an early morning lesson for those who were there – and for us!","","Isn’t it so easy to throw stones? Especially when we see ourselves on the side of right and law and moral rectitude!  We don’t like it one bit when all eyes are on us! But throwing stones from any side never solves anything!","","","","","","","","","","",""]},{"title":"I’m not meself!","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 31st March 2019","","","","You know today’s gospel story very well, almost by heart!  Books have been written about it. Whole courses have been given on the wisdom contained in every sentence of it.  But we haven’t space here for a book – so I will just focus briefly on one word that Jesus uses in his story today.","You know how we say, “I’m not myself! meaning ‘I’m below par!’, ‘I’m under the weather!’, or “I’m not feeling great”. After my father died, my mother used say, very sadly, “I’m living with meself!” as if there were two of them – me and meself!  And there are many versions of me, (and you) aren’t there? Depending on energy levels, state of health and even the weather!  So, isn’t it really gracious of Jesus to suggest that the younger son was ‘not himself’, his real self or his best self when he was thinking only of himself, what was his and how he could get it and spend it and enjoy it – only on himself! He had ‘to come to himself’, come to his senses, come to his true self.  And then he did the right thing! He sought reconciliation with his father.","How could Jesus tell a story like this? How could Jesus have such compassion for an apparently selfish young man who ‘came to himself’ only when he was completely at rock bottom? Is it not because Jesus too had experienced in his own life something of what this young man is going through? It’s a compassion not coming from on high but coming from a real fellow feeling.  This may be hard to understand but let me give you an example that’s very real to me. When at times I feel without energy and definitely down a few notches, that ‘down’ helps me see and understand people in darkness and depression. I’m full of compassion for them and for myself and for the whole human condition and especially for people who are in the depths like this all the time.   In the same way, Jesus’ compassion was not coming from on high. No, it was real fellow feeling because he had experienced similar things himself! St. Paul (in second reading) says that it was for our sake God made Jesus into sin. What does that mean? It’s hard to explain. It means he experienced what sin does to you even though he didn’t sin. What does sin do to you? Sin separates you from God, from other people (like the son from his father) and from your true self. Jesus experienced what it’s like to feel separated from God, abandoned by God, betrayed by God. There’s no darker place than that for one who loves God. And it was “For our sake”. What does that mean? It means that, in Jesus, God came that close to us – and all to convince us that we are loved and understood.","","Only one who knows the desert can lead us out of the desert!","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""]},{"title":"Learn from the fig tree","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 24th March 2019","","","I think Jesus loved trees. He talked about trees a lot! Mustard trees and Mulberry trees, vines, olive trees and especially fig trees! A few times he said we could learn from the fig tree. I also like fig trees and I think I know why. As children, we were always being dosed on Cod Liver Oil, Castor Oil, things called Senna Pods and other dreadful concoctions that I can’t remember. Most of them tasted awful and seemed designed to keep us running for a lifetime! No wonder we haven’t needed them ever since! But there was one we always liked, and it was called Syrup of Figs. Did you ever hear of it? I don’t know if it’s still being produced.","In Jesus’ story today, the fig tree was planted in the good soil of a vineyard. Now that was unusual. Vineyards were for vines! And after three years in this good soil, the fig tree should have been producing figs and it wasn’t. So, the owner says, “Cut it down! It’s taking up precious ground” and the gardener pleads, “Please give it one more year. I’ll dig round it and manure it and if it still doesn’t produce fruit next year, then we can cut it down.”","With Jesus’ stories, as you know, we’re meant to think about them, bring them to prayer, discuss them and work out the meaning for ourselves. I’ll just give you a start!  One thing this story seems to say loud and clear is that we are expected to be fruitful in life, especially when we’re planted in the good soil of peace and freedom, gifted with faith and hope and opportunities of all kinds. Most people don’t need to be told that. They want to make a difference, to give something back for all they have received. But some don’t. They’re ever ready to receive but not to give! Which group are we in? We also see from this story that God is ever ready to give us time to learn from our mistakes; timeto put things right and begin again. What does the ‘digging around’ mean, do you think? And the manuring? I don’t like the thought of that! But sometimes, the ground of our lives needs to be dug up, broken up, ploughed up by some loss or crisis, by some sickness or sorrow, some fear or failure before we become pliable and teachable.It’s often been said “There’s no breakthrough without some kind of breakdown” which we hate at the time and only later see was a needed part of our education.In the words of Kahlil Gibran: “Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding.” Though I prefer to say ‘it can be’because, of course, it can also make us harder and more resistant, as we know well. Afraid to get involved in works of mercy for fear of more hurt.A wise man once told me:","","“I never saw anything till I lost my sight!”","","","","","","","","","","","",""]},{"title":"St. Patrick","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 17th March 2019","","","There’s a word in Greek that we don’t have in English and it’s been described as a word with a caress in it! The word is ‘prautes’ and it’s used all the time in the Gospels to describe Jesus. So, it’s worth getting to know it. It describes someone with a peaceful heart, someone gentle, someone who radiates calmness and deep joy. Jesus himself said this was what he would like us to learn from him: “Learn from me for I am gentle and humble of heart and you will find rest for your souls.”","St. Peter describes the same thing: “Do not dress up for show: doing up your hair, wearing gold bracelets and fine clothes; all this should be inside, in a person’s heart, imperishable, the ornament of a sweet and gentle disposition – this is what is precious in the sight of God. (1 Pet.3:3-4)","I feel the word ‘prautes’ describes St. Patrick too. He was gentle and humble and ordinary, surprised to find himself in such an important role. Yet people like this are also very strong because they depend completely on God – not on their own strength or cleverness. This is how he described himself: “I am Patrick, a sinner, most unlearned, the least of all the faithful, and utterly despised by many.” He was ashamed of what he called his poor education and his poor Latin. Listen again to his own words: “I had it in mind to write but I hesitated until now. In my case what I had to say had to be translated into a tongue foreign to me. I am unable to speak in the way my spirit and mind long to do, so that the sense of my words expresses what I feel.”","I’m sure he did his greatest work by the kind of person he was, by his gentleness and respect for people so that the words he spoke weren’t all that important. Like our Charles who never really mastered English! But it didn’t matter because the words he spoke came from his heart. His faith and his love were genuine and obvious for all to see!","So, being like St. Patrick is being open and honest, not ashamed to let people know you believe and hope, and letting people see you pray and trust in God. Neighbours or those you work with, even those you live with, may sneer and say, “You’re not still into all that stuff!” There’s no need to say much in response.","Just show by the way you live that all that stuff really matters!","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""]},{"title":"Jesus was tempted","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 10th March 2019","","","It seems to be a law of life that after every high there’s a low; when you’ve a great experience, watch out for the low that may well follow!  I’ve seen in the lives of the saints; I’ve seen it in my own life; I see it even in the life of Jesus! How can I say that? Surely Jesus didn’t have highs and lows. But he did. He was human in every way that we are. Today’s gospel happens just after the high of his Baptism, when the heavens opened and he heard God, his beloved Father, saying to him, “You are my beloved son. My favour rests on you.” After an experience like that he must have felt fit and ready for anything! But what happens next? He’s led, by the Spirit, to the low of the desert where he is tempted in every way that we are! How many times have we heard that?  But it’s hard to believe it, isn’t it? Ah no, not Jesus! Can’t have been as bad for him as it is for us! I’m convinced it was even worse for him. The more highly sensitised you are, the more aware you are of all that is going on around you, the more in love you are with people, the more you will enjoy and the more you will suffer!","And Jesus was the most highly sensitised and compassionate human being that ever lived. Because of that, he was all his life wrestling with his vocation. His vocation was to save his people. That was clear but how to do that was not at all clear. Encouraged by God’s words, he was led to consider various possibilities: maybe by improving their lives materially; maybe by choosing the way of power and freeing them from oppression; maybe by jumping from the heights of the temple and having the angels save him from harm and so winning their allegiance. But he saw these were all temptations to be rejected. They seemed good like all our temptations seem good at the time. But they weren’t God’s way! God’s way was the way of slow patient teaching and seeming failure. It wasn’t just in the desert or the garden that he wrestled with this and begged to be spared. It was there all the time!","Remember the day when he was so sharp and impatient with Peter, calling him a ‘Satan’? And all because Peter was saying these awful things can’t happen to you. You won’t be rejected. We can’t allow this to happen! And Jesus is sharp, I’m sure, because he’s afraid himself. Humanly, he’d like to agree with Peter!","But did you ever wonder how do we know what Jesus experienced at his baptism or in the desert or in the garden? It must be that he wasn’t ashamed to tell those close to him about his experiences, good and bad.  And while, in the gospel today, they are told like external happenings, they were, of course, struggles in his mind, heart and soul. That’s where the battle rages. That’s where the battle is won or lost. And if it’s won, like in the desert, it’s only for a while, not for all time. With us too, the battle to be faithful is never won once for all. It continues right through life. The battles we fought and thought we won in early life return fresh as ever in later life. It’s normal. We know that. And it was the same for Jesus. (see Hebrews 5:7,8)","","","","","","","","","","","","",""]},{"title":"The Sunday before Lent 2019","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 3rd March 2019","","","It’s hard to believe but next Wednesday is Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent and Lent means spring and lengthening of days. The gospel today reminds us we’re always in need of spring-cleaning.","This is true story.","John was adopted as a tiny baby and always knew he was adopted. In his teens, he had loads of pals but was easily led and was a great worry to his parents. Nothing they said ever got through to him – except this! One day he arrived home and announced that the girlfriend of one of the pals was pregnant, but it wasn’t really a problem because she’d probably get rid of it! The mother who adopted him was shocked and said, “It! Get rid of it!  Listen, John, did you ever think, if your mother thought like that, you wouldn’t be here at all!” And she told me that was the first thing that ever seemed to get through to him. He went pale, his jaw dropped, and it was his turn to be shocked!","I’m convinced that all of us need to be similarly shocked into seeing things. As the gospel today says, we can be blind to many things about ourselves and not know it. Remember when Jesus shocked Peter by telling him he was a Satan? No doubt he didn’t like it at the time and probably didn’t believe it. He knew he wasn’t a saint but not a Satan either! But later in the courtyard, cursing and swearing that he didn’t know the man, he began to see how true it was. We can go through the whole of our lives thinking we’re nice and good and humble, wouldn’t hurt a fly and we don’t see or want to see how we can be a Satan at times, maybe a lot of the time, jealous, sneaky, mean and ambitious.","In a book called, “If you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him!” by Sheldon Kopp, there’s a powerful passage on the need to accept our dark side if we are to avoid its power over us. He gives this example: “A patient comes into therapy complaining that he does not get along with other people; somehow he always manages to say the wrong thing and hurt their feelings. He is really a nice fellow; just he has this uncontrollable neurotic problem. What this man does not want to know is that his “unconscious hostility” is not his problem, it’s his solution! He’s really not the nice fellow he thinks he is; he’s a bastard who wants to hurt other people while still thinking of himself as a nice fellow. If the therapist can guide him into the pit of his own ugly soul, then there may be hope for him. Once this man can see how angry and vindictive he is, he can trace his own story and bring it to the light, instead of being doomed to relive it all the time without awareness. Nothing about us can be changed until it is first accepted.”   That’s obvious, isn’t it, but hard to take!  But isn’t it a thousand times better than never waking up to how selfish, proud, jealous, scheming we can be? Everyone else can see it but we don’t!  Let’s allow the Lord to shock you into life this Lent. It’s a moment of grace when it happens. It can bring a spring to our step and put spring in our hearts!","The best day in Peter’s life was the day he admitted to himself, “Yes, Lord, I am a Satan!” And he went out and wept bitterly.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""]},{"title":"The Lord turned and looked at Peter","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

I was afraid I would find some accusation in his eyes for some unrepented sin. Or a demand: something he wanted from me.","One day I summoned up courage and looked. There was no accusation.

He said if you didn’t know them, you’d think they didn’t like each other at all. And why? Because they hardly ever seemed to talk to each other. He’d be sitting at one side of the fire, lost in the local newspaper and she’d be sitting at the other side, knitting or darning. And not a word between them!","But, if she got up to go out to the kitchen, down would come the paper and he’d grunt, “Where are you going?” and she’d say something like “Oh never mind! I’m only going out the back!” In other words, there was a wordless conversation going on all the time. He was aware of her presence and needed it and only when it was broken in some way, does he awaken to that need: “Where are you going?”","As children we learn formal prayers and are encouraged to say prayers morning and evening. And that’s good. But our prayer needs are bound to change as we grow older. Some people lament and say, “I wish I could pray as I used to pray.” But if you’re praying as you used to pray, it means you haven’t grown in your relationship with God at all. We can pray and come to God only as the people we are today, with all the questions and complexities of today. And like the old couple at the fire, we don’t need many words. We’re aware of God’s presence and we’re happy about it and only when it’s broken in some serious way, do we realise just how much it means to us.","We pray with our feet or with our wheels when we come to mass or confession. The very decision and effort put into coming to mass or confession is saying “Lord I need you. I can’t live this Christian life without you. I need a bit of encouragement. I need to be able to begin again….and again! Remember when the prodigal son decided to change his ways and return home, he prepared a big speech: “I will go to my father and I will say to him: ‘Father I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am not worthy to be called you son.’… But he didn’t get saying a word of the speech he prepared so well. Why? Because his father saw him coming and ran out to meet him and hug him and welcome him home.","There was no need for many words!","","","","","","","","","","",""]},{"title":"Wanting to be ordinary","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 10th February 2019","","","When I was a child in Primary school and not yet eight years of age, (I know that because we transferred to the De La Salle school at eight) a Passionist priest came into the classroom dressed in the habit with the heart badge, the mantle, the sandals, the whole works! He was Fr. Fergus Clark, a native of Navan. The teacher, a Mercy Sister, asked me would I like to be a priest like Fr. Fergus. And I was very definite in my answer: “Oh no!” I said, “I want to be an ordinary priest like Fr. Herbert!” Fr. Herbert was the local curate.","I discovered much later that Fr. Herbert was anything but an ordinary priest and that the Passionists were very ordinary indeed despite the strange way they dressed! But during our years of training and studies, we were separated from home and family. We were told we were leaving that world and joining another world, ‘a world within a world’, called ‘a state of perfection’. Though I was  young, and knew nothing about Religious Life, some innate wisdom (no doubt from home!) told me there was something wrong with this and I feared it. But I didn’t call it wisdom then; I just thought I wasn’t strong enough, detached enough, or spiritual enough. On the rare occasions I gave voice to my fear, I described it as the “fear of losing touch with the man on the bike.” That man on the bike was my father and symbolised for me ordinary human life in family and work and all that was good and genuine in that. I didn’t want to be different from the rest of humanity and certainly not from ‘the man on the bike’ going home after a hard day’s work.","How happy I was in later life to find Thomas Merton, the great spiritual writer of the last century, saying, “The illusion of a separate holy existence is a dream. Not that I question the reality of my vocation, or of my monastic life: but the conception of ‘separation from the world’ that we have in the monastery too easily presents itself as a complete illusion: the illusion that by making vows we become a different species of being, pseudo angels, spiritual men.” And he concludes by saying, “Thank God, thank God, that I am a man like other men, that I am only a man among others – it is a glorious destiny to be a member of the human race.”","","I’m so happy I’m no different from the man on the bike!","","","","","","","","",""]},{"title":"A prayer for this Sunday","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

I found it early in the week when I wasn’t looking for it at all, and then was happily surprised when I discovered what the gospel was for today. I felt sure I was meant to share it with you.","","Heavenly Father, as parents, grandparents, teachers, priests, we sometimes find it difficult to communicate with our young people. Help us to have the freedom to say what we see is right and true. Help us, at the same time, to be like Jesus who wasn’t angry but understood that no prophet is ever accepted in his own house. Give us the humility to trust that you will send someone else, a Jesus person, who will be able to touch the hearts of our young people.","","We thank you that you send us people like Jesus who shock us into seeing that we’ve been hiding behind the identity of the group we belong to. They remind us you have also blessed people who don’t belong to our group, like the humble widow visited by the great prophet, Elijah, and mentioned by Jesus in the gospel today. It’s a painful lesson, especially when coming from someone in our own household and we can complain, like the Jews today, “This is Joseph’s son, surely; what right has he to be teaching us?” But it can be a moment of great grace for us. A moment when we realise we must stop looking down on people of other ethnic or religious groups, and join with members of other churches, religions and faiths, in asking for your mercy and forgiveness.","","Father, you know that often our first response is to become enraged with those who tell us these home truths. We are liable to take them to the brow of the hill our church is built on, intending to throw them down the cliff of rejection. We thank you that the Jesus you sent us slipped out of our grasp and walked away, leaving us to ponder this truth. We thank you that eventually we will find life in the gracious words that came from his lips.

In 2004, she spoke at Westminster about the movement and the future of multi-ethnic, multi-cultural and multi-faith societies like we have in so many countries today. She said: “When it began, no one had any projects or plans in mind. The idea for this Movement was in God, the design was in heaven. Even with our most optimistic predictions we could never have imagined that we would see the progressive coming together of this “people”, as Pope John Paul often describes our movement.","","It brings together, like a real family, people of different languages, races, nations and also faiths, because being made up of numerous Christians of numerous churches, there are also followers of various religions and people who do not have a religious faith but who share with the others great human values such as justice, solidarity, peace and human rights.”","","In 1997, at the suggestion of Rabbi Jack Bemporad, Sacred Heart University in Fairfield Connecticut recognised her contributions to interreligious dialogue. In his presentation of the honorary degree, the rabbi noted how “her love, her light, her joy, and her work have done so much to unite humanity in all the nations of the world. I know that the work of Focolare and the work of Chiara Lubich is a work that will continue because her work is founded on two basic ideas.

Ninian passing by my window on his way to French class. And why? Because he had only one student for French but there was more fuss about that one student than about all the others in the Juniorate! The time was the first years after my ordination when I was teaching in our Juniorate in Crossgar in Co. Down. It’s hard to believe now that there were at least five young Passionist priests involved full time in teaching. At weekends, we helped out in parishes all around Co. Down.","Was I wrong to make fun of poor Ninian or was it just a little wickedness? It’s true some humour can be hurtful but good humoured, humour, which hurts no one, seems to be applauded in scripture: “Be not just to excess, and be not over wise lest you be ruined. Be not wicked to excess but do not be a fool.” (Eccles. 7:16- 7.)\n  The inspired writer is asking religious people to keep their feet on the ground and seems to infer that a little wickedness is not all that bad!  It would be serious if I said something like Mark Twain said about a recently dead acquaintance: “He was a solemn, unsmiling, sanctimonious old iceberg who looked like he was waiting for a vacancy in the Trinity.” He also said, “I have never killed a man, but I have read many obituaries with great pleasure.” And Oscar Wilde said of someone he knew, “He had no enemies, but he was hated by his friends.” He also said, “Some people cause happiness wherever they go and others whenever they go.”","The writings of St. Teresa of Avila are full of holy common sense, good humour and a little wickedness. In her sublime commentary on the Song of Songs, she describes a lady full of self – importance, all mixed up with religion and devotions, and Teresa says, “She and others like her were saints in their own opinion but when I got to know them, they frightened me more than all the sinners I have ever met!” I didn’t know till recently that St. Therese also had a great sense of humour which, it’s thought, she got from her father. “She had a particular gift for mimicking the tone of voice and mannerisms of other people,” according to her sister, Leonie, but made more fun of herself than of others.","A sense of humour is a very serious sense. It’s a sense of balance, enabling us to take serious things seriously but not to take anything, especially ourselves, too seriously!","","","","","","","","",""]},{"title":"He will baptise with The Holy Spirit","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

But I shouldn’t be surprised since Jesus was born and came among us so that he could baptise us with his spirit. It’s this baptising and anointing that makes us children of God. And these words from St. John’s letter on January 2nd. really got through to me as if I had never heard them before: “You have not lost the anointing he gave you and you do not need anyone to teach you. The anointing he gave you teaches you everything. (1 John 2:22)","In recent times, I have been delighting afresh in the wisdom of St. Therese and wondering how she could be so wise while still so young. She didn’t have degrees in Theology or anything. Yet she is a Doctor of the Church. Where did she get it all? Of course, the same was said about Jesus himself! “Where did he get all this wisdom? Isn’t he the carpenter’s son!”","And sure, the answer is obvious. Therese was educated by God’s Holy Spirit and so were you, and so was I. There is spiritual wisdom in us through the anointing of God’s Holy Spirit. And I see it so often in people who are struggling with all kinds of problems and troubles. They themselves don’t see how good and how wise they are, but they are! They are gifted by God’s spirit. They are led by God’s Spirit.","But it’s also good to remember we’re all led in different ways. St. John of the Cross said, “God carries each person along a different road, so that you will hardly find two people following the same route in their journey to God.” This helps explain that, while we are all children of God, and maybe members of the same family or community, we find it so hard to understand one another. It explains, too, why you may be disappointed in what you hear at mass on Sundays because it doesn’t speak to your situation, or your experience.","We need to pray this prayer: O God, who by the light of the Holy Spirit dost instruct the hearts of thy faithful, grant by the gift of the same Spirit that we may be always truly wise and ever rejoice in his consolation (and education!), through Christ, our Lord, Amen.","","","","","","","","",""]},{"title":"The story of The Magi","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

God’s word is a light, an encouragement, when we feel lost as we often do. “Your word is a lamp for my steps!” (Ps.119) We’re always longing for sunshine, aren’t we? But it’s inner sunshine, sunshine in our hearts, that we need even more. We need this deep joy of God in our hearts: Remember two disciples on the way to Emmaus. They were down and depressed but when Jesus explains the scriptures to them, they are transformed: “Were not our hearts burning within us,” they said, “as he explained the scriptures to us?” Joy is part of being a follower of Jesus but it’s a deep – down joy. It’s not surface stuff or passing highs! In fact, we can have storms on the surface of life without losing this kind of deep inner joy because it’s not based on passing things. St. Thomas Aquinas warns us not to let sorrow or guilt, even for the greatest sins, deprive us of this kind of deep peace and joy. Like the Magi, we must keep moving on.","The Magi also hand over the substances used to control life in their magic arts – gold, frankincense and myrrh. And for all of us, this is the hardest part of all.  To yield control, to hand over our lives, our work and our future into the hands of God! Remember Jesus’ struggle in the Garden: “Father please, I beg you, take this chalice from me! Let me save my people in some other way. Please not this way!” He pleads and struggles with God as we often do, if we take God seriously. But he always yields; he always surrenders, “But not my will or my way, but the way you want it!”  In very ordinary language:","Don’t give in too soon but don’t hold on too long either!","","","","","",""]},{"title":"Happy Christmas!","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

Then one little fellow announces to all \nhis pals, “One day I’m going to come back to this school!” And a little girl down the line pipes up, “Sure you’re coming back tomorrow, aren’t you?” And they all have a great laugh.","There was similar confusion a few years ago when my sister’s grandchildren were helping her put up the Christmas decorations and the crib. All was fine till they got to the crib. They put in the straw and the sheep, the cow and the donkey and then, they put in Mary and Joseph. Little Dara, aged 5, was holding on to the baby because he knew the baby was the important one, so when everything was ready, he put the baby in. But his older sister Sorcha objected, “No, you can’t put the baby in yet” He was very disappointed and asked, “Why?” And she said, “Because he’s not born yet!” And little Dara thought this was ridiculous and said, “But he was born last year, wasn’t he? and If he’s not born yet, then how is he alive now and we pray to him?”","I have great sympathy for Dara because Jesus is born and dies every year all within a few months. And, of course, he’s alive and with us all the time! And even though he’s alive all the time, we can’t put him in the crib till his birthday! It does seem foolish. But we can’t tell Dara we’re just re-enacting Jesus’ life every year and trying to learn from it, because then he’ll surely say, “So it’s not real then?” It is real and it’s a great mystery and not just for Dara.","To think that the great Creator God of the Universe came among us as a helpless little baby.  There are no human words that can express the wonder of this. Every birth is a time of joy and celebration. (I know it’s also a time of fear and anxiety, when much can go wrong). But how can we find a fitting way to celebrate the coming among us of the great God of the Universe in flesh and blood like ours? The wonder continues to this day. That child of flesh and blood grew up to become the body and blood of our Eucharist. He becomes part of us, so we can become part of him. We are the drop of water drowned in the wine as we say every day in the mass: “By the mystery of this water and wine may we come to share in the divinity of Christ who humbled himself to share in our humanity.”","A VERY HAPPY CHRISTMAS TO YOU ALL!","","",""]},{"title":"Coming home for Christmas","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 16th December 2018","","","In our hearts, there’s a nostalgia for home and a longing for home especially at Christmas time. And the clever advertisers play songs about home that would have you in tears in seconds so that, blinded by your tears, you’ll buy whatever they’re trying to sell!  Where this nostalgia is coming from, we may not fully know. Nor may we know what home we’re longing for. But no matter where we are, we’ll never be at home unless we’re at home with ourselves, with what is deepest within us. In that deepest place, there is a memory of God and a longing for God, acknowledged or not. And one way of really coming home at Christmas is by admitting our need to be reconciled with God and with one another. What’s the use of being at home for Christmas if you’re with people you resent, blame or have never forgiven for hurts imagined or real?","In one of the gospel readings this week, Jesus is saying there is more joy in heaven over one repentant sinner than over ninety nine who have no need of repentance. Jesus also said he came among us to call the sinners, not the virtuous! When we were young students and even young priests, we were killing ourselves trying to be perfect (as we were told we should be!) So, we weren’t one bit pleased to be told Jesus didn’t come for us ‘good’ people at all but for the sinners! What’s the use in trying to be good? It would be better to be lost!","Of course, it doesn’t mean that at all! There aren’t two groups, the good people and the sinners. There’s just one group and we’re all in it. We’re all sinners. We’re good but we’re sinners too. We’re good sinners!  So, Jesus is saying, “I did not come to call those who think they have no faults, who think they’re perfect or nearly perfect; I came to call those who know they are frail and lost in many ways. I came for those who know their need.”","There are some, of course, who live in a fantasy world thinking they’re perfect or nearly there: “O God it’s so hard to be humble when you’re perfect in every way!” They can’t face the darkness inside; they can’t admit their failings even to themselves! And the best liars, as we know, are those who believe their own stories! And if they come near to admitting wrong or failure it’s all because of someone else! “It’s not my fault!” And there are those who know their faults very well but don’t believe they can be any different or don’t want to be any different. A small boy prayed: “Dear God, if you can’t make me a better boy, don’t worry about it. I’m having a real good time as I am!” I’m afraid that’s the prayer of many big boys as well! And big girls too! And even God can’t help those who don’t want to be helped!","Then there are those who are only too aware of their sins and get depressed about it all: “I keep failing in the same old ways. I’m fed up with myself. I’m drowning in guilt! Why did God make me like this?”  That’s no good either. Yes, we are all sinners and Jesus came for us all. But we were never meant to wallow in remorse or depression. Jesus came to free us from all that. Jesus came to fill our hearts with hope and peace and joy even while we’re still sinners, now and till the hour of our death, Amen","","Remember the consoling words in the ‘Cloud of Unknowing’: “What God sees with his all merciful eyes is not what we are or what we have been but what we long to be.”","","",""]},{"title":"The 7ups!","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

Or do you say, “How much time do you have?” meaning you don’t want to hear about it. Or do you say, “Great!” “Not bad!” or “Middling!”? That’s a good one – somewhere between good and bad. Nowadays, there’s a new one: “I’m good!” which could mean anything. In the country, the answer often was: “Ah, dead and alive!” I like that one because there’s a truth in it that we, perhaps, don’t fully grasp. We can be half dead a lot of the time without knowing it. In fact, we can prefer to be half dead because to be fully alive in this time and place can be too painful. This can be true even when we are very busy, working hard, with no time to think. Most people’s lives today are complex with pressures of all kinds. You can feel you’re being lived instead of really living!","Last Sunday, Jesus called on us to stay awake and be aware of how we’re living our lives.

Its owners, a husband and wife, don’t live on the premises but a mile or two outside the town. One Friday night after they’d washed up, cleaned up and locked up, they drove home and fell into bed, exhausted. Then about 2 in the morning the phone rings beside their bed and the poor man nearly falls out on top of it: “Yes, what is it?” he groans, and the voice at the other end, slow and slurred, says: “Excuse me, Sir, excuse me, sorry to disturb you but, are you the owner of the Spotted Dog Bar?” And he says, “I am, yes, what do you want?” “I just want to know what time you open in the morning?” And the man tells him and when his wife asks, “Who’s that?” he says, “Oh, just some drunk!”","At six in the morning, the phone rings again. The man answers, again very annoyed because it’s the same voice, only much more slurred: “Sorry for disturbing you! I know you told me, but I forget! What time do you open in the morning?” And the man roars, “Doesn’t matter what time we open because you’re not getting in!” and the voice answers, “Don’t want to get in – just want to get out!” And I can tell you the man wakes up quickly at the thought of ‘your man’ inside downing all his whiskey! He’d have happily released him at 2 in the morning if he’d only known!","This may seem a simple, stupid story but it’s deadly serious. This is what Jesus wants to do for us in the gospel today. He wants to wake us up, shake us up, into seeing what’s important in life and what’s not important. Not to frighten us, but because he loves us. He doesn’t want us to sleep – walk our way through life, thinking we’re going to be here forever. He wants to wake us up to the greed and dishonesty in much of society; to wake us up to the seven deadly tendencies alive and well in our own hearts: pride, covetousness, lust, anger, gluttony, envy and sloth. He also wants to wake us up to how weak and fragile we all are, even the strongest! And wake us up to the reality that we’re not going to be here forever.","I feel my dear sister doesn’t need to hear Jesus’ warnings today because her grandson, Dara, has already issued similar warnings!  When he was eight or nine, he was very worried about his Nana because she has many pains and had difficulty keeping the house clean and sparkling as it always was. So, he said to her, “Nana, when I grow up, I’m going to be an engineer and I’ll make you a robot that will do all the work.” But then he looked very serious, thought for a while, and said, “But sure, you won’t be here then!  But don’t worry, Nana, I’ll help you during my ‘Transition Year’ – that’s if you’re still here!”  Talk about being reminded of your mortality! Talk about being reminded you won’t be around for very much longer! In his innocence, Dara is doing what Jesus is doing today – waking us up, shaking us up to reality! I know you’ll probably say, “Give us a break! We have enough reality! It’s a bit of hope and comfort we need!” That’s true, but I’m sure, too, we don’t want to leave ‘waking up’ till it’s too late.","And I’m saying this to the young and the old and especially myself!","","","","","","","","",""]},{"title":"Christ our King","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

Herman Nolan, C.P.","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 18th November 2018","","","","Fr Herman died on 14th Nov. 2009, the feast of St. Laurence O’Toole. From early on in life, Herman was captivated by beauty of all kinds; he fell in love with beauty in all its manifestations in nature and people, but it was to the beautiful humanity of Christ crucified that he committed himself and his life. “It is only beauty that will save the world”, said Simone Weil, “Beauty is a sacrament; it is Christ’s tender smile coming through the world” Herman was always different, dramatic and passionate. He was a poet, an artist, a mystic, a prophet, a man for the mountains and the mass rocks, a druid, a locksmith who loved fixing things and a goldsmith of words, never happier than when on his bike heading for Glendalough and the mountains! He couldn’t be tied down to timetables or programs – a free spirit in times that were quite rigid. When we were students, he dragged us, protesting, over half the Wicklow Mountains but now these are some of my happiest memories!","One thing we never doubted was his genuineness. He was what he professed to be – a man of God. He was passionate about his faith; Mary and the Legion of Mary was the love of his life.  He went on peregrinatio to Poland and Israel.  The bicycle seemed to symbolise all that was good and simple and green long before the Green party took it up. Frank Duff’s bike was a holy relic hanging from Herman’s ceiling for years. I was always afraid it was going to fall down and kill someone. And poor Herman was so happy when the Legion began again here in Mount Argus, on July 9th 2009, Feast of Mary of Holy Hope.","When he was struck down with Legionnaire’s disease, serious though it was, we couldn’t resist saying, “No wonder! It had to be!” He was in a coma for six weeks and when he came out of that coma, every day and every breath was precious. He kept saying, “I’m bunched!” Yet, he plodded along to Morning Prayer and mass for as long as he could and his laboured breathing, even with the oxygen tank on his back, helped us appreciate just how marvellous it is to be able to breathe normally and deeply. No wonder our ancestors thought of life being in the breath and God’s Spirit being the breath of life. As I said already, Herman breathed his last breath on the feast of Laurence O’Toole of Glendalough, and I can imagine his spirit immediately taking off, with or without the bike, for the heavenly Glendalough!","","“The vocation of the priest is to be a prophet of beauty, to remind people of the light within them. The calling of the priest, like it was for Jesus before him, is not to introduce something new to God’s creation but to reveal, purify and intensify what is already there” Daniel O’Leary.","","","","","","","",""]},{"title":"Get a Life!","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 11th November 2018","","","","This week I want to share with you a speech given by Anna Quindlen at the graduation ceremony of an American university. It is short and to the point:","“I’m a novelist. My work is human nature. Real life is all I know. Don’t ever confuse the two, your life and your work. You will walk out of here today with only one thing that no one else has.  There will be many people doing what you want to do for a living. But you will be the only person alive who has sole custody of your life. Your particular life. Your entire life. Not just your life at a desk or your life on a bus or in a car or at the computer. Not just the life of your mind, but the life of your heart. Not just your bank accounts but also your soul.","People don’t talk about the soul very much anymore. It’s so much easier to write a C.V. than to craft a spirit. But a C.V. is cold comfort on a winter’s night, or when you’re sad, or broke, or lonely, or when you’ve received your test results and they’re not so good.","Here is my C.V.: I am a good mother to three children. I have tried never to let my work stand in the way of being a good parent. I no longer consider myself the centre of the universe. I show up. I listen. I try to laugh. I am a good friend to my husband. I have tried to make marriage vows mean what they say. I am a good friend to my friends and them to me. Without them, there would be nothing to say to you today, because I would be a cardboard cut-out. But I call them on the phone and I meet them for lunch. I would be rotten, at best  mediocre, at my job if those other things were not true.","So here’s what I wanted to tell you today: Get a life. A real life, not a manic pursuit of the next promotion, the bigger pay cheque, the larger house. Do you think you’d care so very much about those things if you blew an aneurysm one afternoon or found a lump in your breast?","Get a life in which you are not alone. Find people you love, and who love you. And remember that love is not leisure. It is work. Pick up the phone. Send an email. Write a letter. Get a life in which you are generous. And realise that life is the best thing ever, and that you have no business taking it for granted. Care so deeply about its goodness that you want to spread it around. All of you want to do well. But if you do not do good too, then doing well will never be enough.","It is so easy to waste our lives, our days, our hours, and our minutes. It is so easy to take for granted the colour of our kids’ eyes, the way the melody in a symphony rises and falls and disappears and rises again. It is so easy to exist instead of to live.","I learned to live many years ago. I learned to love the journey, not the destination. I learned that it is not a dress rehearsal, and that today is the only guarantee you get. I learned to look at all the good in the world and try to give some of it back because I believed in it, completely and utterly. And I tried to do that, in part, by telling others what I had learned. By telling them this: Consider the lilies of the field. Look at the fuzz on a baby’s ear. Read in the back yard with the sun on your face.  Learn to be happy. And think of life as a terminal illness, because if you do, you will live it with joy and passion as it ought to be lived”.","","",""]},{"title":"Remembering Our Dead","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 4th November 2018","","","","This is an early memory of a very famous Jesuit priest and scientist: “I was five or six. My mother had snipped a few of my curls. I picked one up and held it close to the fire. The hair was burnt up in a fraction of a second. A terrible grief assailed me; I had learned that I was perishable. What grieved me then? It was this insecurity of things. At this discovery, I threw myself on the lawn and shed the bitterest tears of my existence.” You may think this was a very unusual child. In some ways he was; he was a lifelong searcher after truth and meaning but there is something of that child and that man in all of us. His name was Fr. Pierre Teilhard de Chardain.","But, what about this letter written to God, also by a young boy? The teacher who gave the children this exercise couldn’t have expected anything like this: “Dear God, I don’t know if I believe in you anymore. I wake up in the middle of the night and I think about dying and about how it might not be heaven. It might just be nothing forever and ever and ever. I wish I could be sure you are there or not. I can’t help thinking it’s just something people make up to make themselves feel good about dying. But I do hope you are real. I don’t mean to be rude, I just want you to know how I feel.  Lots of love, Kevin.”","Again, you may think it unusual that a young child should have thoughts like these? But I’m sure many children have similar questions but never ask them or did ask them and got nowhere. I remember I thought more about death as a child than I do now when I should be thinking about it! That same Jesuit, whose curls were burnt as a child, said late in life almost the same thing as young Kevin: “At the end of the day the only real suffering is doubt. If we could be sure there is a Jesus at the other side everything would be easy.” Of course, he knew better than anyone that if we could be sure it wouldn’t be faith and it wouldn’t be hope.","During November, we will be remembering our loved ones who have died. Along with praying for them, a really good way to remember them is to live well the life we still have and love well the people still with us. It’s always easier to love those who have died. Isn’t it? I love the story of the old man travelling on a bus with a big bunch of beautiful flowers on his lap. Opposite him is a young girl who keeps looking at the flowers and looking away. The time comes for the old man to get off the bus and as he does, he turns to the young girl and says, “Here, you have them. I think my wife would like you to have them. I’ll tell her I gave them to you.” The girl accepts the flowers and watches as the old man gets off the bus and walks through the gates of a small cemetery. Now, you may think, “That’s lovely. He was bringing them to his wife!” But it may not be lovely at all!  It may be guilt, pure and simple!  He may never have brought her a single daisy while she was alive! And now when she doesn’t need them or want them, he’s bringing flowers all the time! In fact, he’s much better giving them to the young girl on the bus.","Shower those you love with flowers now – don’t be keeping them for the funeral!"]},{"title":"Birth Pains","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

An example was a day after Cardinal Ouellet’s very stern rebuke to the Archbishop, we had St Paul saying, “When Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face since he was manifestly in the wrong.” Since the two pillars of the early church were in conflict, it’s not surprising there were disputes and disagreements in the Christian community from the very beginning! And when Jesus was attacked by the Scribes and the Pharisees, his response was not as polite as the Cardinal’s when he called the Pharisees ‘fools’ and ‘unmarked tombs’ and accused the scribes of loading burdens on people, “burdens that you yourselves do not move a finger to lift.” Jesus called a spade a spade!","Bishop Crispen Hollis puts it very well when he says that Pope Francis is being attacked because he is proclaiming \nthe Gospel – the good news that Jesus brought. Pope Francis is experiencing opposition from modern day “Scribes and Pharisees” just like Jesus did. The original Scribes and Pharisees condemned Jesus because he was undermining their vision of the law and subverting their power over people: “I dare to say” says Bishop Hollis, “that the Scribes and Pharisees are alive and well today, often to be found in the Vatican, in bishops’ palaces and in presbyteries. Francis is threatening a legalistic vision of the Church, which is dominated by clericalism and the elitism that can come from that. He may even – perish the thought – be daring to implement the vision of the Second Vatican Council.” With Pope Francis’ constant emphasis on love and mercy, we are discovering the true joy of the Gospel. He is encouraging us to understand that it is vital to celebrate the original blessing in life before condemning what is irregular or wrong.","The birth pains of now will be worth it if we can rediscover Jesus’ vision for the church and do our utmost to be merciful and just and lift people up in hope and joy","","","","","","",""]},{"title":"Passionist Family Group Movement","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

He was full of life and enthusiasm and had come to introduce us to the idea of Family Groups. The idea behind Family Groups is to develop a sense of community in a parish by enabling people to get to know each other and so give people a sense of belonging. The idea is simple yet powerful.","In family groups, people begin to talk to one another, and once people get to know one another, we find ourselves caring for one another and once we start caring, we are forming Christian community.","Family Groups are like an extended family and are open to everyone; young, old, widowed, single people and families. In Family Groups there are no criteria for joining, just the desire to be part of the group – we come as we are because that’s how God loves us – just how we are. All that is asked is that we care for one another.","Following Fr. Peter’s initial visit, the idea was quickly taken on board in Mount Argus. We formed Family Groups of our own and soon the faces of people around us had names; we became friends…. and our parish grew more vibrant.","Fr. Peter returned to us a number of times in the intervening years, always full of good humour and enthusiasm. He fanned the flames of our Family Groups and, twenty years later, Family Groups are still active in Mount Argus, a true testament to the wonderful legacy he has left us.","Fr. Peter was a man of vision, and, as we remember him today; we hope that in faithfulness to the founding spirit and ideals, our Family Groups may continue to promote love, sharing and hospitality in our parish and that we may be blessed with new members.Fr. Peter died on the 3rd March 2018.

I was on my way to visit my cousins, the Marmions. I remember I brought gifts of colouring books for them. Do you remember those colouring books? All you had to do was brush water over the pages and the colours appeared like magic.","Ross Cross was only about four miles outside the town but it was the longest journey I’d ever gone on my own. So I would have been excited and nervous at the same time! The plan was that Thomas Marmion would meet me with horse and trap, but when I got off the bus at Ross, there was no Thomas, no horse and no trap and I never felt more alone and lost in my short life!  Eventually he did arrive and the journey in the trap seemed endless but it was a great adventure over past Dunsany Castle to Derrypatrick.  Mrs. Marmion was my mother’s sister but only much later in life did I learn that it was to this house that the great and saintly Benedictine Abbot, Dom Columba Marmion, sometimes came on visits. I attended the Diamond Jubilee of Sr. Marcellus Marmion and she remembered his visits there when she was a child. She was watching very closely the progress of his cause for canonisation but did not live to see him beatified by Pope John Paul 2 in Rome on 1st. September, 2000, the same day that John XX111 was beatified.","During my student days, I was well aware of Columba Marmion. We were reared on his writings! But only a few years ago did I discover that when he was a student in Clonliffe from 1874 to 1879, he visited a Passionist house and thought seriously about becoming a Passionist. That must have been Mount Argus where Fr.Charles was living and ministering at the time. I’m sure the young Joe Marmion (as he was then known) must have known about Fr.Charles and may even have met him. Later, after ordination, he was a curate in Dundrum for a year and a few years teaching in Clonliffe. Then he left the diocese and joined the Benedictines at Maredsous Abbey in Belgium.","I wrote down these words of Dom Marmion when I was a student. He was explaining how there are priests and religious people who are very learned and who live very strictly but whose ministry is more or less unfruitful. You go to them, he said, in times of trouble, and you meet a brain, head knowledge but no heart, no compassion. And he concluded, “Only the heart touches hearts. We influence people in proportion to our love for them.”","Columba Marmion was so wise spiritually but was easily deceived by imaginary bargains. He loved telling the story of how, as young priest in Dublin, he bought a horse and trap for a community of Sisters and thought he’d got a great bargain. But the horse was old and decrepit and the trap fell to pieces in no time!  Maybe it was fixed up and left to his family?  Maybe that’s the trap I travelled in with Thomas Marmion when I was a child? Stranger things have happened!","","","",""]},{"title":"Lord, change me","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

Then, to make things worse, it began to rain, and I began to feel very sorry for myself. Then I had a vision! I saw Josephine McCarthy, aged 98, cheerfully pushing her little trolley through the wind and the rain – going shopping! She had retired from teaching at least 35 years earlier but she hadn’t retired from life.  For me that morning, it was as if the sun suddenly appeared from behind the clouds.","Many older people enjoy various new vocations but the one they share is that of giving courage to those still on the way. Each old person can be a model for those who may be dreading old age. One of our old priests famously said, “Old age is not all it’s cracked up to be.” Especially when every year seems to steal something from you – a dear friend, your teeth or your driving licence!  It’s essential to remember that time steals from everyone and is not just picking on you!","To grow old with dignity demands discipline. You see it in the faces of those who do. It comes not from one big dramatic decision but from dozens of right decisions made each day: the decision to sit up instead of slouching; the decision not to have ‘just one more’ drink; the decision to stop eating before feeling stuffed! And decisions of the spirit – keeping involved and interested in everything; avoiding self – pity and bitterness.","The voices and faces of some old people give them away. They didn’t develop these overnight. All their lives they’ve been feeling sorry for themselves and blaming others for their plight. In old age they are the same – only worse!","You may find your delayed vocation gives you more joy than the one by which you made your living. And without a new vocation you may find yourself surviving instead of living. Earlier you may have dreamt of retirement as an endless Indian summer but the reality bores you silly!","When you meet people, who are at peace with their lives, like Josephine, who died some years ago aged 104, they seem to spread a light around them whereas the disgruntled ones cast a shadow across the day.

Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 16th September 2018","","","Have you ever made a retreat? Maybe at times you thought of it. Maybe at times, you long to get away from all the depressing news. Even the recent World Meeting of Families and the joy of Pope Francis’ visit was hijacked by other and varied agendas. But maybe too, despite your longing, you just haven’t had the time or the opportunity. Don’t worry – here’s a five-day retreat in five sentences. (With thanks to Richard Rohr!) This is a retreat you can do at home.","","Day 1           Life is Tough.  Life is tough for everyone. Life breaks everyone in some way. As long as we’re alive, we’ll have troubles. It’s a sign of life! Why can’t I just accept that? Why do I continue to be shocked when troubles come my way?","","Day 2           You’re going to die. Nothing surer!  Everyone that has ever lived has died.  So, don’t be so anxious about your health or your cholesterol!  Being less anxious will help your health.","","Day 3           You’re not that important! Of course, you’re important – you’re a child of God, you have a high destiny – but you’re not that important in the scheme of things. People have walked this earth for 50,000 years, some say for 200,000 years – so stop taking yourself or your life or your big job or anything too seriously!","","Day 4           You’re not in control of everything!  Maybe you’d like to be, and there are control freaks around who try to be. But so much in life is out of our hands; so much we cannot control or anticipate.","","Day 5           Your life is not all about you!  Of course, it’s about you, it’s your life, the only one you have and it’s not a rehearsal but it’s not all about you. It’s about other people as well – all the network of relationships in family and neighbourhood and society. We’re part of something greater, we’re part of the ocean of life, we’re part of God and because of that, even though we may crash like waves on the shore, we can reform and begin again.","","Maybe all this talk annoys you, puzzles you or confuses you? You would probably need to take the whole five days to understand it – and certainly a lifetime to live it!  But try it. Work with these statements; bring them to your prayer. Repeat them (or some of them!) to yourself every new day.  They can help.  They can be freeing in so many ways.","",""]},{"title":"What is happening to our Church?","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 9th September 2018","","","","Much is being written about the sickness of our church not just in Ireland but all over the world. In Ireland mass attendance is falling, schools are dropping religious education, vocations are drying up and lay people are not being prepared to take more responsibility for the maintenance of parishes. Fr.  Bernard Cotter, a parish priest in Cork, in a recent Tablet article, says, “To say priests in Ireland are disillusioned would be a dramatic understatement”","It is said that Pope St. John XX111 was never alarmed by changing times in church or state because he had a sense of history and it had all happened many times before. And many years ago, I wrote down (from where I can’t remember) this description of a former time of change, which I think has some similarity to ours. “The world of the middle ages was coming to an end. There were economic, institutional, intellectual and religious collapses and transformations. The church – state synthesis that had held Europe together for a thousand years was crumbling. There was decreasing respect for church representatives. At the highest level, the papacy and the hierarchy were infamous for their corruption, decadence and secular greed.  The sumptuous palace and finery of the Avignon Papacy, which existed from 1309 onwards was an infamous mark of its slide away from spiritual values towards secular and political interests. To fill the vacuum of meaning, a quest for some new systems naturally arises which are independent of the collapsed ecclesiastical and institutional structures.” And it seems the focus on mysticism developed from that. Maybe that’s why Karl Rahner, foreseeing our times, said, “In the days ahead, Christians will be either mystics (those who have experienced God for real) or nothing at all.”","We certainly need faith and hope that good can come from our time of crisis too. So often it takes crisis to open our eyes to the need for change and a new way of doing things. In fact, this crisis could help Pope Francis because he sees this clearly. He has stated that the Church needs “to proclaim the Gospel in a new way, one that is more appropriate to a world and a culture that has radically changed.” We need a change of culture in the church as well, in which clericalism is banished and in which full and open debate can flourish.","It’s probably foolish to talk about such complex issues on one page. The change that is needed cannot happen overnight. And you’ve seen already how much opposition there is to Pope Francis, even within the Church. He certainly needs our prayers."]},{"title":"Fr. Sylvius","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 2nd September 2018","","","For the last ten years, Fr. Sylvius crossed the car park, every Thursday and Saturday morning, to hear confessions. He was always anxious about it – this crossing – and with good reason, especially in recent years. The wind seems to blow through our \ncarpark like winds howl through mountain valleys. And Sylvius was so fragile he was afraid of being blown over and falling. And on Saturday morning, June 23rd last, he did fall but it was after he reached the seeming security of the church porch. He tripped and fell and hit his head on the stone steps. He was taken to St. James Hospital where he died on Tuesday, 26th of June and his funeral mass was on Friday,29th of June.","Our Cemetery has been transformed in the last year and Sylvius was heard to say, “It’s so beautiful we’ll all be dying to get into it!” I wonder did he have a premonition that it would be happening so soon for him? Sylvius worked in South Africa for most of his priestly life and In January 1998, I went there to give him a well – deserved six month’s break. My six months developed into nine years, during which I came to know and appreciate his work in the mining towns of Westonaria and Carletonville and later in Hartbeespoort. All the years he was very aware of the need for security and I remember the shock it was when we heard there was a break -in at his house in the middle of the night, the windows were all shattered and he was dragged out in his bare feet and pinned down with an iron bar on his throat. He must surely have felt he was about to be killed. Experiences like that do terrible things to you. So, he came home to Mount Argus. In the years since then, he suffered from Parkinson’s disease and grew progressively more frail. Still he was quietly content, felt so secure and was so grateful for everything. He was always quite reserved and became more so towards the end. The words he spoke more than any other were words of gratitude and appreciation.","We thank God for him. Despite the Parkinson’s and the frailty and the fear of falling, he was faithful right to the end to the Confessional and to Sunday mass in St. Gladys.

Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 17th June 2018","","","","In the Scriptures, God is constantly wanting to train us and educate us into his own family life and love. And what we gradually come to see is that God teaches us best in the things we wish to God had never happened to us: “Is my gloom after all /Shade of his hand outstretched caressingly?” (Francis Thompson, “Hound of Heaven”)","God teaches us best in ways we don’t like at all. Often, we need to be broken up by life – by some sickness or sorrow, by some fear or failure, by some loss or separation before we become pliable and teachable. Often, the ground of our lives needs to be ploughed up, broken up, by some pain or suffering before we allow ourselves to be helped, to be healed, to be ministered to. God’s word can’t get through to us because we want to manage, we want to be in control, we want to be strong; we don’t want to need anyone or anything! Remember Peter. Only when he was drowning did he cry out for the help that, in fact, he needed all the time: “Lord, save me, I perish! I’m going down!” In other words, there’s no breakthrough without some kind of breakdown, which we hate at the time and only afterwards see was a necessary part of our training.  (The Lord trains those he loves, and suffering is part of your training” Heb.12: 5-7.) I hated it when my mother was laid low with cancer and my father with dementia. I hated it when I had to leave people and places I loved and was expected to start over again in a new place. I didn’t like it one bit when, about the age of 40, (a long time ago!) I went through a period of great disillusionment with myself, first of all. I realized I wasn’t the good and holy priest I foolishly thought I was going to be, when I started out; the Passionists weren’t the perfect Congregation I once thought they were; and neither was the Church the perfect Church I once thought it was! But all this was a necessary part of my training. If I was living with illusions, I needed to be disillusioned! I needed to build my faith and hope on God’s love and mercy for us all, imperfect though we are. As Kahlil Gibran said, “Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding,” Though I prefer to say, “Your pain can be the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding.” because, as you know well, it can also make us harder and more resistant to the help and the training we need.","You will remember the hymn: “Spirit of the living God, fall afresh on me, melt me, mould me, etc.” Well I used to hate that hymn, or maybe, more truly, I was afraid of it, because I knew there was every possibility that I could melt! Tears came easily and, with my name being ‘Waters’, I could imagine myself flowing out under the door! Why did I feel like that? I think for the same reason as Peter. I didn’t want to be weak or appear weak. I remember at the same time seeing a poster which said:","","I thought I was being strong and now I realise I was only being safe.",""]},{"title":"A Desperate Plea for Help","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

Here she writes with great honesty about her experience of cancer and all she’s learned from the experience)","“When diagnosed with cancer, you get to experience something that normally only happens once one has died, at their funeral. You get to see how much you are loved by those around you who will literally do anything to make you smile. And you will become an observer in how your diagnosis changes the lives of these loved ones. This has certainly been my experience. I can feel this love in the dark of the night when I’m scared. It floats around me in the air in a pink swirl and helps me breathe when the fluid on my lungs gets too bad. It cheered me on as I shouted at all the oncologists, doctors and nurses and banned them from my room so I could meditate. And it held my heart so very gently as I prayed it was healthy.","It came in the form of the steady stream of beautiful, intelligent friends who have given up weeks to come and care for me here in this foreign country. They cook for me, carry my bags, look deep into my eyes as my veins are prodded with endless infusions and they make me giggle in delight at silly things.","When I was diagnosed something changed forever. All the mundane bulls**t fell away. Living became my only goal. And my husband completely stepped up to support me in that. We searched our past to try to figure out why my body created such a desperate plea for help. We found that stress was the driving force behind my illness and the key to my healing was the opposite of that – peace. He is the most incredible man I’ve ever met. He has held me every single step of this journey while also readily facing his own demons, because we know that actually if I am going to fully heal, then he also has to change his life. We have painfully torn down the dysfunctional foundations that we unintentionally created over 12 years. And haven’t left any stone unturned.","It’s been a tiring and uncomfortable time for us as we have had to talk through so much that has stayed in darkness for a long time. But we both know that this is the only way I can heal and also that we have to do it so we can raise our son in the manner that he deserves. I am in awe of my husband’s brute strength to keep going through his exhaustion, to keep walking our dogs and to keep driving me to appointment after appointment. To also keep caring for our boy, calmly soothing him and cultivating a relationship that is so beautiful to witness. To help me with every single difficult decision I have had to make, and remind me that I always have a choice.","Somehow among it all, we have snatched moments to look into each others’ eyes, to breathe together, to cry together and remind each other that I am healing every day.”",""]},{"title":"Let Jesus Shine on You! 2","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

And it was very wise indeed, even for Africans! We long for summer sun and when it does come, we can so easily forget that we need sun block and umbrellas far more than Africans do. But there’s a sun break you can take at any time of year and you won’t need any protection from the sun. Neither will you have to travel very far. Just make your way to Mount Argus church any Wednesday or Friday and lie back – well, maybe not lie back! ‘Sit back’ would be better; close your eyes and let Jesus shine on you! You won’t need sun block of any kind. There are no harmful rays. Just get rid of anything that may be preventing you from looking at Jesus and allowing him look at you. Allow yourself to bask in the sunshine of God’s love. This will do you a world of good. It can be an oasis of peace in your week when you can de-stress and get another perspective on your problems. And this is not false advertising. Way back when God was teaching us how to bless one another he gave us these words:","“May God bless you and keep you.","May God let his face shine on you and be gracious to you.","May God show you his face and bring you peace.” Num. 6:24.","We all need times of silence, peace and quiet. But, so often we feel we should be doing something more productive forgetting that much can grow and flow from the moments of doing nothing. Much “is born in contemplation, from moments of intense communion, and from the deep relationship of friendship with Christ, from the beauty and light which was seen shining on his face.” Pope John Paul 2","For many years now, people have been gathering in Mount Argus on Wednesdays and Fridays to be with Jesus present in the Eucharist. Having people gather with us and having a commitment to a definite time can help us to be faithful. There are days we don’t feel like praying at all. Those are the days we probably need it most. Just like there are days we don’t feel like meeting, even with friends, and those are the days we need it most! So why not plan to meet with Jesus, your friend, at least once a week? You don’t have to phone, text or email. He’s always there. He’s always present. Always ready to welcome us. The golden rays of the Monstrance are a reminder that he’s shining and smiling on us.","","The Real Presence of Jesus in the Eucharist is given to us so that we may become His real presence in the world.","",""]},{"title":"God rejoices eternally in intimacy","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

When my friends tell me it’s dangerous for my health and happiness? When my teenage daughter – like many of her friends – finds it dull, misogynist, unrelated to real life?","I stay in a place that undeniably gives me heartache. Women denied selfhood and autonomy. Gay friends denied the sacraments, ministry, and priesthood. A church governed by rules and regulations that are grim, and life denying.","All the same I stay. Not because I’m a hero. I stay because the same church, which denies life, also holds in its hands a radical gospel that is more life enhancing than any of the packaged goods I see on religious supermarket shelves. I stay because the church tells me that, as God became human, so I too will become divine. It proclaims that my bodily life in all its messiness is part of the being of God, since God has become bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh. It teaches that my relationships are meaningful because they mirror a God who rejoices eternally in intimacy. I stay because the church reassures me that I belong to a community without limits in space and time, at one with all creatures, living and dead. It shows me how I am part of creation’s journey towards God. It makes sense of my pain, setting human suffering in the hopeful frame of Christ’s passion, death and resurrection.","I stay because, as a biblical scholar, I am part of a community that is re-reading ancient texts in new and exciting ways. I love the Bible – in all its beauty and terror, its craziness and depth. The bible shows me what it means to be human, to be in community with others, to be in harmony with the earth, to be in relationship with God.","I stay in the church because when I fall in my life there are hands held out to lift me up, to hold me, to forgive and accept me. Dreadful though church leaders and teachers can sometimes be, they can’t hide the treasures of the gospel. Nor can they eradicate the traces of courageous women who lived and loved within and beyond the boundaries of the church.","I stay to be at the feet of such grace and spirit.

Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 13th May 2018","","","","John Hogan was one of Ireland’s greatest sculptors. He was born in Tallow, Co. Waterford in 1800 but lived and worked in Rome for many years. One of his works is on display in the atrium of our still new house. All the years it was in the library of the old monastery where few saw it. At first sight it could be the Transfiguration on Mount Tabor or the Ascension into heaven but with second sight (and good sight!) you will see the imprint of the nails in Jesus’ hands and feet. So, it is the Ascension and Jesus carries the wounds of his Passion in his glorified body. This has something very important to say to us.","","Charles Peguy tells the story of a man who died and went to heaven and the recording angel said, “Show me your wounds” and he replied, “Wounds? What wounds? I haven’t any wounds!” And the angel asked, “In your whole life, did you never think anything worth fighting for?” It’s a good question isn’t it? Think about it. What have you fought for? What are you still fighting for? What has wounded you, broken you, along the way? Jesus was wounded because he was passionately involved with people, he defended the weak, he spoke out against injustice, and he challenged the sick systems of his time and place.","","If we are fully alive and involved with people, there is no way of avoiding wounds. Life breaks everyone in some way but the great thing and the saving thing is to grow at those broken places. And this is not just talk! It happens. You see it in people. You maybe see it in yourself. You may be broken by loss and separation, by betrayal or marriage breakdown, by failure or sickness or addiction but when you come through the experience, it can fill you with great understanding and compassion for others. Or, of course, it can do the opposite; it can make you harder, more bitter, resentful and protective of yourself – “I’m never going to get involved like that again! No one is going to hurt me like that again!” If you do that, you’re choosing to die before your time. We need to see that God is trying to educate us through everything that happens along the way of our lives. And that means everything – the good and the bad! Often the only way we learn anything worthwhile is by suffering it! Don’t ask me why it has to be like that, but that’s the way it is!","","Our wounds too can become glorious wounds.

And many years more before I realised that ‘being perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect’ didn’t mean what we mean by ‘being perfect’ anyway. What does it mean? It means becoming what we were created to be. We were created in the image of God and being God – like means loving in the sense of wishing well to all people – not just our families and friends and those close to us but all people, even those who have hurt us and those we maybe regard as enemies. Jesus explains it (and probably said much more at the time!) by saying that his heavenly Father “makes the sun to rise on bad men as well as good and his rain to fall on honest and dishonest men alike.” Long years ago, my poor mother down in Meath used ring her daughter, my sister, here in Dublin for a wee moan and a bit of comfort and she’d say something like, “The weather’s miserable, isn’t it?” and my sister would look out the window and say, “No, the sun’s shining here – it’s lovely!”  And mother would be disgusted, and would mutter to herself, “Of course, it’s always shining in Dublin!”","Dublin does seem to fare better than the rest of the country but it’s not because we’re better than the rest. God shines on us anyway and being like God means working to think positively and to shine on all people – not just friends but those we regard as enemies. In fact, it’s also an invitation to love ourselves and forgive ourselves because we can be our own worst enemy! A Vietnamese Buddhist monk with a strange name, (Thich Nhat Hanh) helps us understand people who hurt us: “When other people make you suffer, it is because they are suffering deeply within themselves.  They don’t need punishment; they need help – that’s the message they’re sending out.”  Bring this thought to your prayer today. I know it’s hard to see this, especially when people are annoying you or hurting you, but that’s what it means to love like God loves. That’s the kind of ‘perfect’ worth working towards –  and it’s work for a lifetime!","",""]},{"title":"The Stuff of Holiness","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 22nd April 2018","","","The following is just a brief summary of what the Tablet Magazine has to say about Pope Francis’ new document, ‘Rejoice and be glad’.","“Holiness has something of a bad name. It popularly means one of two things; either being so unworldly as to be hardly on the planet at all, or to have assumed an air of spiritual superiority that distains lesser mortals more subject to the temptations of the flesh. In his audacious new apostolic exhortation, Pope Francis has embarked upon a very personal definition of holiness that breaks through these blockages and turns these preconceptions upside down.\nMost Catholics would shy away from imagining holiness either as applying to themselves or as a serious aim in life and are probably not comfortable with being thought of as “religious”. Yet the call to holiness is universal, and the practice of it should be as natural and familiar as any good habit. The parent who cares lovingly for a child, the carpenter who deftly repairs a damaged wardrobe, the owner of a business who behaves honourably and conscientiously towards their staff and their customers, indeed anyone who aspires to become the person God means them to be, is engaged in becoming more holy by virtue of it. Holiness is not remote from everyday life. It is the very stuff daily life is made of. Anyone can be a saint.\n‘Rejoice and be glad’ is a remarkable document and could be regarded as this pope’s spiritual masterpiece. A thousand sermons could be preached on it and everyone in the congregation would instantly sense that the Pope is talking to them personally. But he does not shirk controversy. He identifies two skewed brands of Catholicism, which he calls Pelagianism and Gnosticism, which block the flow of grace and kill holiness dead even while claiming to be its defenders. These two ancient mindsets also happen to be apt descriptions of the ultra – conservative positions occupied by those who have been most hostile to his papacy. Francis is coruscating and relentless in his criticism of rigidity, legalism and traditionalism. They result, he says, in a “self-centred and elitist complacency, bereft of true love…”\nThis inspiring document should not be misunderstood as simply Francis’ response to his critics. Like all good spiritual writing, there are lines on every page that will make all readers uncomfortable. But Pope Francis clearly regards his job not only as comforting the afflicted, but also as afflicting the comfortable. At which he undoubtedly will succeed.”"]},{"title":"Here we go again!","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 15th April 2018","","","That’s what I felt like saying when we celebrated the Annunciation on Monday last and began again the round of Jesus’ life from conception to crib, cross and resurrection. How often we’ve done that! It’s repetitive but not boring because it’s never the same and we’re never the same and hopefully, as the years roll by, we can enter more and more into the mystery of it all. We may think our lives are humdrum and ordinary and forget that Mary’s life was humdrum too and quiet most of the time and would probably have looked boring to the casual observer. Nobody could have seen how extraordinary that ordinary life really was – even her next – door neighbours or her extended family. They wouldn’t have been writing about her in the local paper if they had a local paper or interviewing her on T.V. if they had T.V.","Thomas a Kempis wrote the famous book called ‘The Imitation of Christ’ and in it he said we should “enjoy being unknown and regarded as nothing.” Enjoy being unknown? What that means is being able to keep going through our ordinary every day lives, not needing the oxygen of recognition and praise, but doing good things that are seen by God alone. Most of us, if we were blessed with good parents, started life as the centre of the universe! All our smiles and tears were noticed and responded to! You could say it was our first addictive experience and after that, it was hard to get used to being just one of a family, or later one of a whole class or school and hardly noticed. I know I tossed my sister out of my pram and was never let forget it. And she, in her turn, tossed my young brother out of his/hers! I remember too, hearing about Hannah aged 9, who scolded her brother Adam, aged 7 like this: “Adam, life is not all about you, you know!” and he replied, “Yes I know, I know, but it was before Mia arrived!” Which shows he did know he was the centre of attention up to then.","We know, too, there are people, like some celebrities, as we call them, who never recover from this baby addiction to being the centre of attention. It seems like oxygen they desperately need. They can’t survive without notice and applause and spend all their energies looking for it. On the other hand, it was said of one man that the only applause he needed was applause from his own conscience. That’s good, isn’t it? It’s good to remember, too, that Jesus, apart from his last three years, lived a quiet hidden life, and Mary lived a mostly quiet life, cooking and cleaning and looking after the hens! And that is where most of the good in this world is done, by parents and carers and all who keep going through the unnoticed daily round of working, loving,  and doing the best they can.","","",""]},{"title":"Doubt No Longer","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 8th April 2018","","","Faith in the Resurrection of Jesus, as we know, is at the heart of Christian faith. Yet we often struggle with doubts, don’t we?  Even though, according to St. Paul, without the resurrection of Jesus, everything else collapses.  St. Paul knew it wasn’t easy to believe. That’s why he said, “If Christ be not raised, we are of all people most to be pitied! “ He glimpsed the dread possibility!","I know you meet people who say they never had a doubt in their lives and that is certainly a great gift of God. But it can also be that some are afraid to allow themselves to doubt even for a moment.  And may blame those who have doubts! But doubt is not the opposite of faith. It’s part of it. Theologian, Paul Tournier, goes further when he says, “Where there is no opportunity for doubt, there is no opportunity for faith either.” And the Jesuit, Fr. Gerry Hughes, wrote, “Those who rest in unshakeable certainties no longer live in faith, although they often pride themselves as being the only people who have faith.”","It’s because of all this that Thomas, doubting Thomas, gets a starring role and more talking parts in John’s gospel than in the other gospels.  And that’s because John also knew that believing in the bodily resurrection of Jesus was always going to be difficult for believers. It was difficult even for those who saw him after the resurrection. So no wonder it’s difficult for us. Thomas, needless to say, wasn’t the only one who doubted. He was just more honest and blunt about it: “Unless I see the holes that the nails made in his hands and can put my finger into the holes they made, and unless I can put my hand into his side I refuse to believe.”","Part of his problem, of course, was that he ‘wasn’t with the others when Jesus came.’  He was elsewhere, drowning his sorrows alone. He felt let down by all that had happened. The great hopes they had, all dashed! But most of them stayed together. They gathered with Mary and supported one another in their grief. We, today, still need that same faith support. We need to gather together at least once a week to remember Jesus and his word.","The next time Jesus appears among them, Thomas is there. And Jesus takes him so gently. He doesn’t scold him or blame him for his lack of faith. He knows they’ve never experienced anything like this before, so he quietly says, “Thomas, give me your hand; examine my hands and feet; examine my side too. Doubt no longer but believe.”","Jesus is saying the same to us today, “Give me your hand, I will walk the way with you, I know it’s not easy for you. No life is easy. But I will be with you every step of the way.  I know you want to be able to understand all this. But you can’t.  It’s impossible. It’s too much for any human mind. Neither can you live a life of faith without me. But don’t be afraid. I will be with you. Blessed are you who cannot see and yet believe.”","It was said of the first believers that their joy was so great they couldn’t believe it! We can be like that. We won’t let ourselves believe in case we’re let down. We hold back!  Don’t hope for much and you won’t be disappointed! That kind of thing!  I’ve had to take myself in hand many times through life and almost shout at myself, “For God’s sake and your own, stop thinking that reading, study and analysing will answer all your questions. Why can’t you just trust Jesus? Jesus can’t deceive us; Jesus won’t deceive us! Help me to pray with Peter:","","“Lord, I do believe, help my unbelief.”","","",""]},{"title":"Easter Joy","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 1st April 2018","","","","It’s been a long cold winter and we have warnings of more of the same – even at Easter! So, more than ever we need to experience the joy of Easter. More than ever we need to be reminded that there is life after death; that Jesus’ death and resurrection is the pattern for us too. You remember those who saw him after his rising just couldn’t believe it. “Their joy was so great they couldn’t believe it!” We are no different. We have no problem believing death and depression and betrayal because we see so much of it in our world. But joy and hope are just as real, and Jesus lived and died that we might have life and hope and joy. The following poem by Pablo Neruda (loose translation by F. Monks) is a call to hope and courage. Hope it encourages you this Easter:","We die slowly when we are slaves of habit, retracing the same paths every day, never changing the colours of our clothes, never meeting new people, never venturing.","We die slowly when we prefer black to white and are so rigid we never allow ourselves to experience those emotions, which bring a sparkle to the eye, turn yawns into smiles, and confront the heart with wonder and love.","We die slowly when we are unhappy at work, refuse to risk leaving the secure and safe for the uncertainty of following a dream, when we never once allow ourselves a crazy moment!","We die slowly when we never travel, never read, and never listen to music.","We die slowly when we destroy our self-respect, when we refuse love, when we constantly lament our misfortune, the heat, the cold, the constant rain, (even snow!)","We die slowly when we abandon a project before it begins, when we don’t question what we don’t understand, and refuse to respond when asked something we don’t know.","On the other hand, we avoid death in small doses by always remembering that to live requires far more effort than simply breathing!","","HAPPY EASTER!","","","",""]},{"title":"The Lord turned and looked at Peter","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 25th March 2018","","","Why was Peter hanging round the courtyard?  Was he watching, waiting, and hoping to catch a glimpse of Jesus as he was being brought through? Or was he too busy saving his own neck, cursing and swearing and trying to prove that this man, Jesus, meant nothing to him, that he didn’t know him, that he wasn’t interested in him? But why hang around? It must have been difficult to pretend that he was there just to warm himself at the fire. When he wasn’t defending himself, he must have kept watching and wondering what was happening now. What was happening to this man who had been everything to him for the last three years, who had turned his life upside down, his friend and hero, the man he admired, loved, trusted and hoped in for a great future? What had gone wrong? When would the nightmare end? This man deprived of his freedom, ridiculed, humiliated! But what could he do now? He had been told to put the sword away. Would he also be taken in for questioning? What would he say? What would he do? Would he go on denying? Could he go on denying?","Absorbed in his own fears and anxieties, he seems to have been taken by surprise. But something tells you when eyes are on you and he comes up out of his blinding darkness to find Jesus looking at him, looking straight into his eyes. “And the Lord, turning, looked straight at Peter.” He was being led through, pushed through the crowd, so there wasn’t much time! The turning, the looking, must have happened in seconds. Jesus didn’t stand and stare at Peter. There wasn’t time for that! The turning, the glance was so brief, Peter must have wondered had it happened at all or had he imagined it?","But what an impact a look, even a brief look, can have! We’ve always known looks can kill but looks can give life as well. What was it like, this turning, this looking? I’m sure Peter himself would have found it difficult to describe. There are probably no words for an experience like that. What was it like, this look? A lost bewildered look maybe? Was one eye swollen, as in the film? Was he searching for a friendly face? It certainly wasn’t a look of condemnation. He was glad to see Peter. I am sure the look said it all: “It’s all right, Peter, I know all this is a shock to you. You didn’t let yourself believe it could happen! You don’t know what to do, man of action! You are afraid; I can understand that; I am also afraid. I’d love if there were some other way. I’ve prayed for that. But this is how it must be.”","Jesus had said so many things to Peter and the others in their years on the road. But little got through to them! He not only said things but also lived them. His words and example so recently at the Last Supper were so powerful, you might think. But no! They didn’t hear; they didn’t see. They didn’t want to hear; they didn’t want to see.  They were too taken up with their own disputes, rivalries and ambitions.","But this look gets through. This look of love and compassion cuts through to Peter’s heart. Probably because he’s broken up enough to let it through! Probably because he’s ready for it! During this coming Holy Week, it’s important that we plan some quiet time with Jesus. There is no need to be afraid. We will be spending time with someone who knows and loves and understands us better than we know or understand ourselves. Peter had more reasons than most to be nervous and afraid and still, he looked and allowed Jesus to get through to him.","And that look was a moment of grace and the source of his whole future ministry!","","",""]},{"title":"Cry, God, Cry!","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 18th March 2018","","","“During his life on earth, Christ offered up prayer and entreaty, aloud and in silent tears.” Hebrews 5:7 (2nd reading today)","A little lad was listening in to some adults talking about life and the problems of life and when one of them said, “Well, all I know is – God is very good!” he piped up, “My Daddy is gooder than God!” The same little fellow was in a temper a few days later because he didn’t get what he wanted, and he stamped his foot in rage. And this ‘Daddy that was gooder than God’ looked up at the Sacred Heart picture on the wall and said, “If you do that again, God will cry!” And the little lad, still in a rage, looked up at the picture, stamped his foot again and said, “Cry, God, cry!”","This happened. You can see it happening. And even though the little fellow wasn’t impressed, this ‘Daddy that was gooder than God’ had good Theology too! Because he didn’t say, “If you do that again, God will be angry with you, or God won’t love you any more, or God will punish you.”  No, he said God will be sad, God will cry.","And Jesus, who is the image of God for us, wept at least three times that we know of, and only God knows how many more. You remember he wept at the tomb of Lazarus, his friend. And, even though he knew better than anyone that eternal life follows death, it didn’t take away his pain and grief at the death of someone he knew and loved. It was the end of life as we know it and he was weeping for the whole human condition that he was part of.","Another time, as he drew near to Jerusalem, he wept for his own people: “If only you had understood the message of peace…but it is hidden from you.” In him we see the helplessness of God when people don’t want to be helped. Is it any wonder that we, too, often feel so helpless?","We know too that Jesus wept bitter tears of fear and frustration in the Garden of Gethsemane: “Father please spare me!” And in the letter to Hebrews it says, “During his life on earth, Jesus made his prayers with loud cries and tears to God who could save him.” So that’s all through his life! You could say Jesus was even more human than we are, not afraid or ashamed to let us see his tears and his anguish. If we prayed like that, we would probably hide it for fear of being regarded as weak or depressed. I remember in the Charismatic Renewal, we heard about the ‘gift of tears’ and we were singing “Spirit of the living God fall afresh on me, melt me, mould me”, and I used pray, “O dear God, please don’t give me that gift!” I was afraid because I could easily imagine myself melting and flowing out under the door!","Also, we see in almost every page of the gospel, that Jesus was deeply moved by the pain, sickness, suffering and living conditions of people, their bodily hunger and their spiritual hunger. But now, Jesus has no hands but ours to reach out to those in all kinds of needs. Sometimes we’re in need ourselves; sometimes we’re needed. The St. Vincent de Paul group is needed and does great work, the Adoration is needed, the family groups are needed, and the Legion of Mary can and does encourage people to begin again. There are over thirty groups in the Parish and every group and everyone has something to contribute; we need Martha and we need Mary!","","If you feel called to join one of the groups in the parish and don’t know how to go about it, just ask one of the priests on the parish.","","",""]},{"title":"Six Family Principles","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 11th March 2018","","","In preparation for the World Meeting of Families in August next, we are invited to reflect on the theme “The Gospel and Family: Joy for the world”. Cardinal Cupich of Chicago has recently drawn six principles from ‘Amoris Laetitia’, the Pope’s letter on the family, and these should be very helpful in this reflection. First of all, he says that ‘’Amoris Laetitia’ marks a “revolutionary” departure for the church in the way it interacts with and ministers to the family. And that is because family life is “dramatically different from the past” and so many people are “disoriented and uncertain about their lives.” These are the six principles:","Jesus was revolutionary in what he said about marriage in his time. This is just as revolutionary!","","",""]},{"title":"Signs and wonder","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 4th March 2018","","","","In today’s Gospel, the Jews ask Jesus, “What sign can you show us to justify what you have done?” What he had done was organise a riot to protest their turning the Temple into a cattle market or a Super market. And so many times we see the Pharisees demanding that Jesus perform some extraordinary signs and wonders to prove he is the long – awaited Messiah. We remember, too, that this was one of Jesus’s own temptations – to jump from the parapet of the temple and have angels come swooping from on high to save him from injuries. But he, of course, rejects this temptation and these demands and says he himself is the only sign they will be given, just as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites.","I’m sure Jesus would love that photo of the child with the big blue eyes in a recent Bulletin and the message: There are no seven wonders of the world in the eyes of a child; there are seven million! And also, the poem by Elizabeth Barrett Browning: “Earth’s crammed with heaven/And every common bush afire with God/ But only he who sees, takes off his shoes/ The rest sit round and pluck blackberries.”","It’s all about seeing and appreciating. Jesus would say, “Look at the wonders all round you. Look at the sun and the moon and the stars. Look at the birds of the air. Look at nature in all its splendour and magnificence. Look at the films by David Attenborough or, nearer home, look at the cormorants on the Dodder and the kingfishers in Bushy Park! (Above is photo of a cormorant on the Dodder)","Look too at the great spirit in people. I asked prayers at mass recently for a young couple expecting a baby in May. In a recent scan, it was discovered their baby has the condition known as spina bifida, and they were told all that would mean including that their child might never walk, would have serious bowel problems and much more. Needless to say, they were devastated and plunged into grief as for a lost child. But with support from family and friends and their own strong faith, they pulled themselves together and sought all the advice they could get. And last week, they travelled to Belgium where the child in the womb was operated on to release fluid from the brain and hopefully improve the child’s future prospects. I don’t know if I am describing all this correctly but isn’t it marvellous what surgeons can now do?  And isn’t it marvellous to see this young couple doing all they possibly can to give their frail child the best possible quality of life. They have a little boy already who is perfectly healthy, so they never anticipated anything like this.","Please keep this baby and all children with disabilities and their parents in your prayers.","",""]},{"title":"Top Vet Ordained","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 25th February 2018","","","Galileo was a legendary stallion acknowledged as the “best sire on the planet” But that might never have happened without vet Niall O’Riordan and what Niall called divine intervention. Galileo fell gravely ill and needed two surgeries within 48 hours. So, it was no surprise his wound became infected. It was Niall’s job to nurse the horse to health. Despite his experience with thousands of racehorses, Galileo’s temperature continued to spike. It was then he placed Galileo’s fate in the hands of God: “I had been up all night with him. I went to mass at eight o’clock in the morning in Fethard. After mass, I went to the sacristy to Fr Tom Breen and said: ‘Fr Tom, Galileo is sick. Is there any chance you would come and bless him?'” Recalling the priest’s arrival at Coolmore, he says: “The best surgeon from England was there and Doug Byers, ‘the godfather of equine medicine’ and in comes this Catholic priest to bless the horse. They probably thought I was crazy. But that evening, Galileo didn’t spike a temperature again. Many people want to credit me with saving Galileo, but I’m convinced it was the priest who blessed him.”","Niall could have traded as a vet for years on the role he played in saving Galileo. But he didn’t. Instead, he chose to answer the calling he first had at the age of 17 and that was to become a priest. It followed a trip to the Holy Land. He explains it this way: “I really felt such a presence of God while there and was introduced to some of the Sisters from the Family of Mary. Then I met the founder of the community, Fr Paul. Through that, I fell in love with the community, and seven years later, decided to go to Rome and join them.","Asked how it felt to give up his career as a vet, he said: “There are enough vets in the world! As I explained to my father, I was a vet, but what could I do as a vet? I could treat an animal. But what is that compared to being a priest, who can bring heaven to earth and heal souls?” At the same time, he admitted: “It was a big change. When I was a vet, I was used to driving into a yard and having people stop what they were doing to come and help me. Now I had to learn to become the servant. Not that those who helped me as a vet were my servants. But I had to learn to serve. That’s what a priest is. He’s a servant of God and he serves the people.”","Last December, Niall was ordained as a priest with the Family of Mary in the Basilica of St Paul Outside the Walls in Rome. He returned home briefly to visit family and friends, but he already knew his mission would take him to Uzovska Panica in Slovakia, to tend to a community of Roma people. Fr Niall describes it as a world of abject poverty, but the Roma can rely on the care and support of the Family of Mary through its Caritas programme, which regularly distributes food and clothing. And I’m sure their horses will be well cared for too!","Hearing all this, I wondered are there any other vets or non – vets out there who would like to change careers and join our Congregation? From our beginnings, we were to be men of mercy, preaching the mercy and compassion of God for all people. And this, long before Pope Francis put such emphasis on the mercy of God. We were to help people to find God in their own hearts. But we cannot live our vocation in these countries for much longer unless God inspires men like Niall O’Riordan to join us.",""]},{"title":"Shocked into seeing","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 18th February 2018","","","Lent caught me by surprise! I think it always does but this year it seemed sooner than ever. I should be glad, since Lent means spring and lengthening of days! And I would be if it felt a bit more like spring. The evenings are definitely getting brighter, but it’s been so bitterly cold and dreary. Memories of Lent are dreary too! But how about seeing Lent as an opportunity for a spiritual transformation?","This is true story. John (not his real name) was adopted as a tiny baby and always knew he was adopted. In his teens he had loads of pals but was easily led and was a great worry to his parents. Nothing they said ever got through to him – except this! One day he arrived home and announced that the girlfriend of one of the pals was pregnant, but it wasn’t really a problem because she’d probably get rid of it! The mother who adopted him was shocked and said, “It! Get rid of it! Listen, John, did you ever think, if your mother thought like that, you wouldn’t be here at all!” And she told me that was the first thing that ever seemed to get through to him. He went pale, his jaw dropped, and it was his turn to be shocked!","I’m convinced all of us need to be similarly shocked into seeing things. Remember when Jesus shocked Peter by telling him he was a Satan? No doubt he didn’t like it at the time and probably didn’t believe it. He knew he wasn’t a saint but not a Satan either! But later in the courtyard, when he was cursing and swearing that he didn’t know the man, he began to see how true it was. We can go through the whole of our lives thinking we’re nice and good and humble, wouldn’t hurt a fly, and we don’t see or want to see how we can be a Satan at times, self – absorbed, jealous, sneaky, mean and ambitious.","In a book called, “If you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him!” by Sheldon Kopp, there’s a powerful passage on the need to accept our dark side if we are to avoid its power over us. He gives this example: “A patient comes into therapy complaining that he does not get along with other people; somehow he always manages to say the wrong thing and hurt their feelings. He’s really a nice fellow; just he has this uncontrollable neurotic problem. What this man does not want to know is that his “unconscious hostility” is not his problem, it’s his solution! He’s really not the nice fellow he thinks he is; he’s a bastard who wants to hurt other people while still thinking of himself as a nice fellow. If the therapist can guide him into the pit of his own ugly soul, then there may be hope for him. Once this man can see how angry and vindictive he is, he can trace his own story and bring it to the light, instead of being doomed to relive it all the time without awareness.","Nothing about ourselves can be changed until it is first accepted. That’s obvious, isn’t it, but hard to take!  But isn’t it a thousand times better than never waking up to how selfish, proud, jealous and scheming we can be? Everyone else can probably see it but we can’t!  We must allow the Lord to shock us into life this Lent. It’s a moment of grace when it happens. It can bring spring to our hearts and a spring to our steps!","The best day in Peter’s life was the day he admitted to himself first and then to Jesus, “Yes, Lord, I am a Satan!”  His future ministry and leadership grew from that moment!",""]},{"title":"It’s OK to complain","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 11th February 2018","","","","","Pope Francis posted a sign in his house at the Vatican that reads “Complaining is not allowed!”. But in the first reading last Sunday from the Book of Job (which is really a long poem) we heard poor Job moaning and groaning: “Months of delusion I have assigned to me, nothing for my own but nights of grief. Lying on my bed I wonder ‘When will it be day” Risen I think, ‘How slowly evening comes!’ Restlessly I fret till twilight falls. Swifter than a weaver’s shuttle my days have passed and vanished, leaving no hope behind.” And he had every reason to complain. You’ve heard too of Job’s comforters who only added to his despair!  Pope Francis himself often complains about Christians who complain too much, once saying we “have more in common with pickled peppers than the joy of having a beautiful life.”","I’m sure, too, there have been times in our own lives when we’ve lost heart and hope and felt like crying out to God in the same way and probably then felt guilty about it. So, it’s good to know that a third of all the prayers in the Scriptures are prayers like that, prayers of lamentation and complaint. And they are good prayers. One mother I know, told me when her daughter was dying of cancer she felt life climbing to the top of the Mourne Mountains behind their house and howling to God to intervene and do something to save her child. And good people all down the ages who took God seriously cried out like that – even Jesus: “My God, my God, why have you deserted me?”","But there’s great learning in all this. By suffering like this, we learn things that we couldn’t learn in any other way. A theologian put it this way: “In recognising the jagged edges of human existence and the awful ambiguity of living and dying, we begin to understand what it means to hope against hope. Human hopes arise out of a stubborn refusal to give way in the face of so much evil and suffering, out of an extraordinary ability to begin again and again after being touched by tragedy. These hopes, though fragile, are a persistent and universal experience of the human spirit.” A poet said the same thing but far more simply:","“There is an old woman who shuffles along/ With a jug for a pint of beer / Almost oblivious, / Seeking oblivion. / Her hair is in plastic curlers under an old tweed cap.  Her face is the poor face of someone drowned in the sea.","She has never been young/ And her mind is numb/ And she does not see, / She only floats to the surface, /A terrible accusation to me.","A poor drowned bloated face / Floating up from a sea/ Of accepted misery. /And I / Who lower my eyes for shame /As I go by, / Am more ashamed / Because I wonder why / Despair troubles to curl her hair.” – Woman with a Jug. By Caryll Houselander","Why does Despair trouble to curl her hair? You could say ‘force of habit’ or ‘vanity’ or you could say it’s the spark of the divine in us! In that poor, drowned, bloated human being, hope still battles with despair and hope can still win out!",""]},{"title":"Wake up!","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

When we were children we used think that’s what it was for. But there’s a lovely Jewish legend that gives a different explanation. The story is that just before the soul enters the body it is told to be silent about its divine origin. And an angel presses its mouth shut and the little crevice below our nose is the imprint of the angel’s finger. And that’s why when you’re trying to remember something or thinking deeply you put your own finger in that crevice!","There is a deep truth underlying this charming legend. Pope Benedict said there’s a memory of God etched in every human heart, but it needs to be awakened. (‘etched’ meaning engraved in us, burned into us, a memory in our genes) And Pope Francis said something quite similar: “God is in every person’s life…there’s always a space where the good seeds can grow.” But this memory can so easily be buried by circumstances of birth and education and by all the pressures and problems in life. So, it does need to be awakened!","Children, fresh from God, can awaken it. A little girl was delighted when her baby brother was born, and she kept asking to be left alone with the baby. The parents were naturally nervous about this, thinking she might be jealous of the new arrival. But she kept pleading and eventually they agreed: “Alright, but only for a few minutes.” They then made sure the door was left a little ajar, so they could watch as she crept up close to the baby, leaned down and whispered, “Baby, what does God feel like? I’m beginning to forget!” This is a true story and is just one small example of the ways children can help awaken us to the wonder of life and the deep meaning and mystery of our existence on our beautiful blue planet.","Last Sunday I listened to a recording of the heartbeat of a baby in the womb and what a wonder that is. How could anyone, at any stage, for any reason, set out to silence that life?  In Japanese culture, there is the idea that a baby has come from very far away. Its soul is strange in this world and that’s why it’s so important the child be kept close and never be left alone. This strange creature must be made to feel welcome.  In Norway there is a legend that before soul is put in the body, it is kissed by God and during its life on earth the soul keeps a dark but powerful memory of that kiss and relates everything to it. These myths and legends contain a deep truth: that we come from God and our destiny is to return to God.","Jesus was born and came among us to awaken us to that memory and that destiny. It is certainly etched in our hearts but needs to be constantly awakened.

We were living from one half of the soul, from the conscious rational level and we needed to discover the other half, the unconscious intuitive dimension. I wanted to experience in my life the marriage of these two dimensions of human existence, the rational and the intuitive, the conscious and the unconscious, the masculine and the feminine. I wanted to find the way to the marriage of East and West.   From ‘Marriage of East and West’","THE CONVERSION OF THIS POWER","India has released in me the forces of the unconscious and I have sometimes been terrified to find the demonic power which is in me. The spiritual life consists in the conversion of this power. We cannot destroy or supress it. It is not evil in itself; it is rather a holy power coming from God. But it has become subdued to our own selfish interest and so perverted. We have to turn this energy back to God, to withdraw it from sex and all selfish interest and to allow God to take possession of it. This is of course a tremendous battle but all spiritual disciplines are ultimately concerned with this. I have been finding myself lately engaged in this battle as never before. Letter to Nigel Bruce 1960","THE PAPACY","If the Collegiality of the bishops is established, the whole conception of the place of the Pope in the church will have to be revised. The teaching and governing authority of the church is not the Pope, but the bishops with the Pope at their head.

The following are words of wisdom from two young people to be found in a book called ‘Humans of Dublin’.","YOUNG WOMAN: “I was in love, once! It wasn’t until my mid – twenties though, because I’d always been really afraid of getting my heart broken. But then I met a guy. We were together for nearly two years and, while I was still terrified the whole time of getting hurt, we laughed so much together, and he really brought me out of my shell. I was crazy about him, so I thought it was worth the risk. I did get my heart broken in the end, but I would never give back the experience, because everything can change so quickly.","When I started getting sick I still thought everything would work out okay, but my illness became serious really fast and I found out there was no treatment available here. Nothing prepares you for something like this; I’ve had to find more courage and perseverance than I ever thought I could have. Since then I appreciated every memory, both good times and bad and even the heartbreak. I wanted so much to make new memories too, so I’ve been trying to fundraise to go to the US as soon as possible for the medical care that could save my life. There are things I’ll do differently if I get a second chance. I’ll try to let people in more and more and not be so afraid of getting hurt. Whether it will go well or not doesn’t even matter. It’s the chance to live life and even make mistakes, and get back up to try again each day. That’s what matters!”","YOUNG MAN: “In foster care you sometimes feel like your home is unstable, or that you don’t actually have a home. But I think my foster mother was the perfect person for me. She knew I needed my own space, and she knew I needed a home much more than a temporary location, so one of my earlier happy memories of being in care was when she asked me if I wanted to change my room around. I literally jumped at the chance even though, after some time of moving the furniture side to side and all around the room, I eventually resettled them the way they were originally placed. It may seem like a simple gesture, but it’s hard to describe what it meant to me. Later she asked me if I wanted to decorate the room, so we went shopping and I picked the paint and we decorated it together. After that moment I strangely felt that this was my forever home and it wasn’t going to be taken away from me so easily. I felt I was here to stay, which was such a powerful feeling for me. It helped me make the transition from staying in another family’s home to becoming a part of that home and family which I love. And I now have that for the rest of my life.”",""]},{"title":"Baptised by the Spirit","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

Then a priest passed by and I shouted, “Hey Father, help me out of this hole!” but he just wrote out a prayer and threw it in on top of me. Then a social worker passed by and I shouted, ‘Hey you, help me out of this hole’ but he just threw in some money and walked on. Then Murphy passed by and I shouted, “Hey Murphy, help me out of this hole!” And what do you think, Murphy jumped into the hole beside me and I said to him, ‘Murphy, you’re a fool! Now we’re both stuck in this hole!” But Murphy said, “Don’t worry. I know this hole well and I know the way out!  Follow me!”","In the gospel today, we see Jesus in a ‘Murphy’ moment!  Jumping into the situation all his people are in! They are his people. He is one of them. He wants to be one of them. He knows that it’s only as one of them that he can lead them out – through patient teaching, work and suffering. Follow me! How often Jesus said that! Today he wants to officially begin this work. But John the Baptist objects, “You don’t need my baptism! Mine is a baptism of repentance. You don’t need that. This is foolish. This is all wrong!” And Jesus says, “Let it be so for now. This is the way God wants.  So please baptise me, bless me, and anoint me for my ministry!” Jesus had been waiting for the right moment and the right way to begin his life’s mission. That moment has come, and he has come to see that God’s way to realise his vision is the way of patient teaching, personal contact and challenging the religious ‘status quo’ as John had been doing. And just as Pope Francis is trying to do again in our time!","Remember when he stood on the balcony at St. Peter’s Basilica just after he was elected? After his few words of greeting to the thousands gathered in the square, he asked them to please pray to the Lord for him – to bless him as he began his ministry. And he stood with head bowed as the people prayed in silence. I’m sure they were just as surprised as John the Baptist!","Each of us was anointed at our baptism to spread the good news of Jesus, to help people experience the joy of the children of God and to lead them out of whatever hole keeps them enslaved.

She was happy with that, but the whole thing took far longer than if she was doing it herself! There were so many different ideas about everything – the lights, the Christmas tree, who would do what, with the result that Nana, as they call her, was exhausted by the time they got to the crib! But she thought to herself, “Well, at least this will be the easy bit!” How wrong she was!  They put in the cow and the donkey, the shepherds and the sheep, Mary and Joseph. And little Dara (then aged five) obviously knew that the baby was the important one, so he held on to the baby till everything was ready. Then he put the baby in. But his older sister objected, “No, you can’t put the baby in yet!” “Why?” asks he.  “Because he’s not born yet!” says she. “But he was born last year, wasn’t he? asks Dara, “And If he’s not born yet, then how is he here?” (Meaning, I think, that he had him in his hands and we’re praying to him all the time!)","Nana tried to answer this one by saying, “At Christmas we’ll be celebrating his birthday and then we’ll put him in.” This doesn’t really answer Dara’s problem, so he asks, “Is he dead then?” Nana decides to agree with this: “Yes, the bad men killed him on the cross, you remember?” Yes, Dara remembered that all right, but he still wanted to know where he was now!  “In Heaven!” says Nana, hoping this will solve the problem. But not at all! “Where’s heaven?” By this stage, Nana is on her last bit of energy and looks up to heaven. “Oh, it’s in space!” says Dara. Nana, afraid that he might think Jesus was floating around in a space ship somewhere, says, “Well no, further than that!” “Oh, I know!” says Dara, “on a planet?” Nana was by now ready to agree with anything, so she decided to leave Jesus on a planet for the moment and who could blame her?”  “Yes, yes, yes, on a planet!”","I had great sympathy with little Dara (and with Nana too, of course!”) Jesus is born and dies every year all within a few months. And, of course, he’s alive all the time! And even though he’s alive all the time, we can’t put him in the crib till his birthday! And we can’t tell little Dara we’re just re-enacting Jesus’ life story every year because then he’ll surely say, “So it’s not real then?” But it is real and the great Dominican in the Middle Ages, Master Eckhart, understood Dara’s problem very well and he said:","“What good is it to me if the eternal birth of the divine son takes place unceasingly but does not take place within me? and what good is it to me if Mary is full of grace and I am not also full of grace? what good is it to me for the Creator God to give birth to His/Her son, if I do not also give birth to Him in my time and my culture?”","There are no words to describe the wonder of all this. God’s life is in us, God’s spirit is in us all the time – not just at Christmas or Easter!  But we need these special times to remind us of the wonder and the encouragement of our faith.",""]},{"title":"Watching and waiting","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

(Ann Lewin)","","Some time back I was sitting with a couple I’ve known very well for a very long time. We were chatting and reminiscing about our lives when the husband said, “Well, I must say I’m very content with the life I’ve had!” His wife immediately intervened and said, “Indeed you’re not one bit content! You’re always wanting more!” I had immediate sympathy for the poor man shot down when he was just taking off. But, on reflection, I thought how lacking we, the unmarried, are in not having someone loving enough and caring enough to bring us down to earth when we go off on flights of fancy. (Though living in community also helps in keeping you from getting notions about yourself!) At the same time, what the wife said that day struck a chord with me because I’ve noticed even in the very ordinary thing of taking photos of birds or animals and especially recently of the Kingfisher, no matter how good the photos are, I’m still not satisfied. I want more and better ones, always thinking there’s a real masterpiece around the corner!","","And I think, if we look into our hearts, we’ll find something of that same ache there. We want more of all that’s good and beautiful but not of what’s difficult or ugly. And it’s much deeper even than that. We have an aching restlessness that is really a yearning for our beautiful God, though we don’t always recognise it as such. We have expectations and an essential loneliness that no wife or husband or children or friends can fill. And we must beware of putting such impossible expectations on them. Watching for the Kingfisher reminds me of all this. It is like our Advent waiting and watching for the coming of the Lord at Christmas and indeed every day in the Eucharist.","","","","",""]},{"title":"To be a Catholic in the 21st Century","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 19th November 2017","","","","Last May when I fell and fractured my elbow, I was surprised how many people said things like “Ah poor thing!” or “You poor thing!” I wasn’t used to be called a ‘thing’ and yet, it was strangely comforting. I did feel like a small broken thing that was foolish enough to fall and get broken!  And then I remembered that in Isaiah, God comforted his people with similar words: “Do not be afraid, Jacob, poor worm; Israel, puny mite. I will help you.” (41:13-20) I’m sure we mightn’t like to be called a ‘worm’ or a ‘puny mite’ but in Isaiah this was the language of tenderness and intimacy. It was the language of a mother comforting a small child. The people were shivering with fear, shrinking from troubles on every side, but were held fast by God’s right hand. Our struggle is that while we know and believe that we also are in God’s hands, we often don’t feel it. Or we feel it when we’re healthy and strong, but we don’t feel it when we need it most, when we’re feeling small, weak and helpless. We’ve to live a strange paradox, knowing how weak and fragile we are but knowing also that we are in God’s hands; that the God we can’t see, or touch, is closer to us than we are to ourselves because his Spirit dwells within us.","All this is not easy even for those who take God seriously, who love Jesus and want to follow him. When we find that after all the years we’re still so weak and sinful, we can be discouraged and feel like giving up on it all. I’ve known so many good people (priests, sisters, brothers, parents and single people) who suffer like this. It is good people who suffer like this. The gospel ideals are meant to be like beacons encouraging us to keep quietly working towards them. But they can have the opposite effect! St. Bernard said, “The greatest enemy of the good is the perfect,” meaning the high ideals we have can so discourage us that we don’t even achieve the good that we could if we weren’t so depressed about the whole thing!","I heard Tom Murphy, the playwright, say in a radio interview, that when he was a young man, he had to rid himself of the idealized image he had of himself that was crucifying him; and filling him with guilt when he failed! I feel many of us were like that. And it can have little to do with God at all. It can be a cult of self- perfection and we’re just upset and annoyed with ourselves when we fail. I’m not the good holy person I thought I was and wanted to be!","St. Therese was so young but so wise when she said, “Resign yourself to stumbling at every step, even to falling; love your powerlessness. What a grace it is when in the morning I feel no courage, no strength to practice virtue.”  That’s the opposite of what we want, isn’t it? We want to be spiritual successes! But she said: “Those who are living in the spirit of the gospel are not anxiously looking to see the results, are not concerned about how much progress has been made. They live by faith and confidence, giving themselves completely over to God’s mercy.”","","","",""]},{"title":"Grief is the price we pay for love","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 5th November 2017","","","I discovered Leon Bloy a very long time ago when I was a student. I had a card on my desk with his words “Everything that happens is something to be adored.” I know that sounds extravagant, but God can and does bring good from everything. St. Paul said, “We know that all things work together unto good for those who love God.” Rom.8:28. And St. Augustine added “even our sins” – “all things, even our sins, work together unto good for those who love God” I can’t remember how I came across Bloy’s novel, “The Woman who was Poor” but I do remember the impact it had on me at the time. His novel and others like it inspired me more deeply than the Theology we were studying at the time. I tried to read the novel again recently and found it anything but inspiring! But it reminded me of how disappointed I was with our study of Theology. The dogmas of faith seemed more like mathematical formulas proven from scripture \nand tradition. It didn’t help, of course, that we studied Theology through the medium of Latin. Because of this, I was delighted, some years back, to discover that when Pope Benedict was a student, he too found the Theology of the Scholastics absolutely dry. And a seminary prefect from the time, called Alfred Lapple, explains it this way: “As they would say in Bavaria, that kind of Theology wasn’t his beer!” He wasn’t interested in defining God by abstract ideas. An abstraction, he once said, didn’t need a mother! But he loved the works of St. Augustine and you know why? Because, (and these are his own words,) “the passionate, suffering, questioning man or woman is always right there and you can relate to that.”","Leon Bloy was a French novelist and essayist that no one mentions much nowadays. He was born in 1846 and died in 1917. A convert to Catholicism, his writings inspired a wave of conversions in France during the early 20th century that included personalities such as the painter Georges Rouault and the philosophers Jacques and Raisa Maritain. He also made many enemies because of the things he said about people, but he defended himself by saying that he was communicating only the mercy and the indignation of God!","I’ve been quoting Leon Bloy over the years and the following will give you some idea of how he wrote:","“God seems to have condemned himself until the end of time not to exercise any immediate right of a master over a servant or a king over a subject. We can do what we want. He will defend himself only by his patience and his beauty.”","“We have places in our hearts which do not yet exist, and suffering must enter there so that they may have existence.","“The only real sadness, the only real failure, the only great tragedy in life, is not to become a saint.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             “Chance is the modern name for the Holy Spirit.”","But Bloy must have been smiling in heaven when Pope Francis quoted him in his first homily as pope: “When we walk without the cross, when we build without the cross and when we confess Christ without the cross, we are not disciples of the Lord: we are worldly, we are bishops, priests, cardinals, popes, but not disciples of the Lord.”"]},{"title":"We Are All Disabled In Some Way","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 29th October 2017","","","I wrote about Jean Vanier recently. He established homes for handicapped people and there are now 143 L’Arche communities all over the world where ‘normal’ people live with and assist those with disabilities. But Vanier never wanted to make a distinction between ‘normal’ people and people with disabilities because of his conviction that we are all disabled in some way. This is how he explained it:","“As children we have been hurt. Our first experience of pain was on that day when, as a little child, we sensed that we were not wanted by our parents, when they were angry with us because we did not fit into their plan or do what they wanted us to do. We cried out and disturbed them when they did not want to be disturbed or we did something that annoyed them. We were so little, so vulnerable then, so in need of love and of understanding. We could not understand that this breakage came from fatigue, emptiness, inner pain, and wounds of our parents who could not bear to hear our cry and that it was not “our” fault. We had to escape, then, into our dreams, projects and ideas. When little children are hurt, they close themselves up, hiding behind unexpressed anger, revolt and grief, sulking and depression, or they escape into a world of dreams. This breakage is like a dagger entering a fragile craving for communion. It causes horrible loneliness, anguish, inner pain, feelings of guilt and shame.","Children feel they have hurt their parents and have disappointed them. No child can understand or bear this inner pain. Children cannot judge or condemn their parents whom they need so much just to survive. So, they withhold and hide their anger and blame themselves. They know then that they are no good, unlovable, misfits that nobody wants. Human beings learn to cut themselves off from all this inner pain, and thus from reality, and especially from the reality of people who cause or reawaken inner pain. We are all so broken in love, and in our capacity to relate. We have difficulty understanding others and wanting their growth and peace of heart. We can quickly judge or condemn them. We hurt each other. We seek to control or to use others, or to run away and hide. Since we were little children we have hidden this pain deep down within us, in a forgotten world with solid barriers around it. It is in this forgotten world of early pain, rejection, and confusion that the thirst for love and communion is wounded, and then relationships become dangerous. So, we tend to live not in reality but in dream, in ideologies and illusions, in theories and projects, things that bring success and acclaim. The barriers around our hearts are deep and strong, protecting us from pain. We live in the past or in the future or in a dream.”","We must let ourselves be healed by others and come to deeper self-knowledge. There’s no end to this process. We must also accept others as wounded people, bear with them and contribute to their healing. We can’t do this on our own so let’s pray for the constant support and spiritual energy that we need."]},{"title":"Fr. Salvian Maguire, CP 1925-2017","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

You can see the young man or woman in the old. And that was certainly true of Fr. Salvian who died last Sunday night at the ripe old age of 92. It \nwas no problem at all to imagine him as a child, a student or a young Passionist heading off to Paraquay with Fr. Theophane Cooney and Fr. Mel Collier to start a new mission there. I love this photo of him on his horse setting out to visit the sick in the parish. He looks completely in his element. As we know, life breaks everyone in some ways but Salvian never seemed to lose his wonderment, his enthusiasm and delight in life. Also, he had an enquiring mind and never ceased wanting to understand things.","He was full of wonder about nature and all the new knowledge about the earth and the universe. And he was quite at home up there in the spiritual stratosphere exploring the mysteries of our faith in his homilies. He enjoyed walking and in recent years was so happy when wheeled around the garden and the park. I’m sure too he won’t ‘make strange’ when he arrives at heaven’s gate.","Everyone remarked that Salvian had a great face, a most expressive face, with big eyes ready to break into laughter at all the foibles and craziness of human nature. He was our Provincial Superior from 1974 to 1980 and showed he had vision by planning, with others, various courses to help us explore our humanity and recognise that we had feelings as well as brains and to rid us of any illusions we might have  about ourselves. Up to that, training for Religious Life and Priesthood focussed largely on intellectual and spiritual formation, as we called it. At the time we called these courses “Our Road to Damascus” which being translated is “to demask us!”","I’m very conscious this is such a brief word about a very good man and priest. There was far more to Salvian than I can record here. He was a man full of concern for others, who lived up to that well known axiom “As you live so shall you die” He lived a cheerful positive life of faith and hope and in his last years he was equally cheerful and concerned about everyone but especially Nurse Teresa and his many devoted carers, all the time enquiring, “But how are you?” May he rest in peace.",""]},{"title":"Fr. Julian Black CP – 1936-2017","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 15th October 2017","","","Fr. Julian died last Sunday in Botswana after many years of patient suffering. He was born and reared in Ballycastle, Co. Antrim and his family there have been praying that at last he would be freed from suffering and pain. Yet when he did die, they and I were in a sort of disbelieving shock that such a great-hearted man, priest and brother was no longer with us. He’s been described as a poet, artist, mystic, teacher, a visionary and friend by those who have known him.  He was ordained on 22nd December 1962 and was sent to Botswana, then known as Bechuanaland, in September 1963 at the age of 27. This photo of the younger Julian says it all. In it, we can glimpse the energy, the enthusiasm and the great spirit that carried him throughout his whole life.  He was assigned to Thamaga mission in 1983 where he started many different projects, including pottery making, dress making, leather craft and a small shop where residents could sell their wares. The most successful project was the pottery, which still employs about 20 people.  At one stage, Julian asked permission from Bishop Murphy to spend one year praying and meditating in the desert. The Bishop gave permission. So, he lived in a battered old caravan in a place called Tshane beside a salt pan. He did have a truck and so was able to drive to Hukuntsi to buy supplies and especially water. This no doubt led to his ministering to his beloved Basarwa people in the Kalahari Desert for about fourteen years. I’m sure, too, his time there inspired many of the poems in his book called Safari of the Spirit.","Julian’s great spirit was especially needed when in midlife he was struck down with Muscular Dystrophy. He wrote much later, “Nearly twenty years ago, I received a special grace.  A mutation of the muscles that made me change my pace”.  Imagine calling Muscular Dystrophy a very special grace.  But this was genuine with him.  Everything was genuine with Julian. He accepted “the change of pace” with great patience and resignation. I’ll never forget the agony it was for him to get from sitting to standing when saying Mass. I used to fear he would fall and hit his head on the great stone altar in Forest Hill in Gaborone. Forest Hill, and the beautiful chapel there, were largely designed by him and based on an African village.","On one page I can give you only a brief glimpse of this good holy man. When I visited him in 2013, it was extraordinary to see the number of people who came to visit him every day in his small rondavel. No matter what was his state of health, he listened to them and prayed with them. For many years now, he has been cared for by Bro. Brendan Gallagher, a brother of Fr. Dermot. When Brendan comes home later this month, it will mark the end of our direct involvement with the mission in Botswana which began in 1952.",""]},{"title":"Each of us needs more love than we deserve","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 8th October 2017","","","A question for you. Do you find yourself agreeing or disagreeing with this statement: “Each of us needs more love than we deserve.”? I came across it in a book called “The God who won’t let go” by Peter van Bremen. I know you may need time to think about it or debate it with others, but what is your instinctive reaction?","I’ve had time to think about it and, at first, I thought there was something wrong with it. I think this is because at one time, I wouldn’t have expected to be loved if I didn’t deserve it. I’ve have expected myself to work harder so that I might deserve it. I think this is because from early childhood we’re inclined to link being loved with being good. If I’m not good, I won’t be loved. Did you feel that?","A young mother was at mass with her two little boys. The older of the two was restless and she was pleading with him “Please try to be good; it won’t be long now.” And he was equally plaintive in his response: “I can’t. I can’t. I always be bold!” I’m sure we have sympathy for both mother and child in that situation. But ‘being good’ must seem the most impossible thing in the world for a little lad who’s always being told he’s bold!  And I feel as we grow older we’re not very different from that little lad. As we were at home so we can be with God and when Jesus puts great ideals before us and asks us to be good, we may feel like crying out too: “I can’t, I can’t, I always fall short; I try but I keep falling down!” The result is we feel God can’t love us very much and we don’t love ourselves very much either – and don’t forget, we’re supposed to love others as we love ourselves! And all this mess is because we think being loved depends on us and how good we are.","And Jesus is constantly telling us in the gospel that we are loved and it doesn’t depend on how good we are. It’s not because we deserve it! It’s because we need it. We need more love than we deserve.  Remember the little lad not yet 11, who wrote this letter to God: “Dear God, why did you like the prodigal son better than his brother? Do you like good people better if they do some sins first? Yours sincerely, Alan.” Jesus would have been delighted with that young lad who wondered why the one who messed up before he caught himself on seemed to be celebrated and loved more than the one who was faithful and never strayed. Of course, it’s not that he’s loved more than his brother; it’s because he knows he needs more love than he deserves. And so does the older brother, though he may fancy himself as being faithful and good.","","Each of us needs more love than we deserve.","",""]},{"title":"Light in Troubled Times","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

The young people of today think of nothing but themselves. They have no reverence for parents or old age. They are impatient of all restraint. They talk as if they knew everything, and what passes as wisdom with us is foolishness with them. As for the girls, they are foolish and immoderate in speech, behaviour and dress.”","Maybe you’re inclined to agree with some of these sentiments? I know we often wonder what’s the world coming to when we look at the T.V. news or read even the headlines in the newspaper. It seems there’s nothing but disasters all over the world. But the above was written, not in yesterday’s Independent or the day before either. It was written by someone called Peter the Monk giving his views of contemporary society way back in 1274!","There’s nothing new under the sun! Even the great Aristotle, who said many wise things, said something similar: “When I look at the younger generation, I despair of the future of civilisation.” It looks like it has always been like this and probably always will. In our young days, punk rockers and ‘teddy boys’ were the latest horror until someone discovered there were similar boys in St. Augustine’s time! It’s said that Pope John XX111 had a great sense of history and because of that he was convinced that that our world is no worse and probably an awful lot better than in previous times.","But without faith and hope in God and without the light that Jesus brings, it is very difficult to make sense of life on earth in any generation. We are privileged to have that treasure and that light. So, we mustn’t be shy or afraid to share it with others and spread that light in every way we can. Instead of moaning about the wrongs and the seeming chaos of our times, why not together take seriously Jesus’ invitation to let our light shine. Let people see that hope and confidence in God shining in us and our lives. You probably wonder how you can do that. It can be difficult on your own but why not consider joining a group like the Legion of Mary or the St. Vincent de Paul that are already doing this? We all need support and encouragement to keep doing anything and you will find that support in these groups. The local group of the Legion meets here in Mount Argus every Monday evening at 7 and there’s a standing invitation to come and see! Come and see how the Legion works and whether you could see yourself being part of such a group and learning to share your faith with others.

Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 24th September 2017","","","","In 1964, a tall, handsome, ex-naval officer, Jean Vanier, was invited to the village of Trosley, 40 miles north of Paris. He was invited there to visit an asylum for men with mental handicaps. “It was a horrific place” he said, “full of screaming and violence and yet it filled me with a sense of wonderment. I sensed in these men a great cry – ‘Do you love me?’ ‘Will you be back?” He visited other asylums, equally dismal. And then, like the Good Samaritan, he just did something! He bought a tumbledown cottage in Trosley and invited two men with handicaps to leave the asylum and live with him. He called their home L’Arche, “the ark”.","He had no big plan. He just wanted to ease the suffering of two men. But, as he shared his life with them, he gradually discovered that he was being changed by them. “God had chosen the weak and the foolish to confound those living in their heads” he said, reworking the words of St. Paul. They helped him live from the heart. “They were”, he said, “teachers of tenderness”. Today, there are143 L’Arche communities all over the world. In each one, “normal” people live as assistants to people with handicaps. A devout Catholic himself, Vanier and L’Arche welcomes people of all faiths and none. What is needed is the ability to love people as they are.","Vanier has been listening to people’s difficulties for 53 years now. You would think he would be overwhelmed by so much pain but he says “often when I meet people, it’s a healing experience for me. I’m not a healer; all I can be is a good listener. And that seems to be the healing part for people – that someone appreciates them.” “People” he says, “Are caught up in guilt – there’s a whole element of anger against self and broken self-image. So, in listening to people you’re going through a barrier of self- disgust. My life in L’Arche has taught me that there is goodness and beauty in everyone.” So loving people is helping them see that.","Jean Vanier invites us to gently reflect on three questions: Where are the poor in my life? Who are the poor to me? And how am I a consoler for the weak and the suffering? Each one of us, he says, can make a difference – “even if only how we look at people. When you pass someone begging on the street, it’s not a question of ‘Do you give him Euros?’ so much as ‘Do you look at him as a human being?’ When you begin to let people who are ‘no good’ into your life, you are transformed.”","I have admired Jean Vanier since I was a young priest and read his books. We often ask what the whole thing is all about. Jean Vanier has no doubt:","“When we die, it’s not a question of what we’ve done but of how we’ve loved”",""]},{"title":"Heroic Witness of Chiara Petrillo","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

Her story is one that will shock some and inspire others. Only a brief outline is possible on one page. Chiara refused lifesaving cancer treatment that would have damaged or destroyed her baby in the womb. Baby Francesco was born perfectly well but she died. The background is complex but Catholic moral teaching would say she could have had the treatment without blame even if she knew there was a good chance her baby would be killed as a result. The intention was to heal her, not to kill the baby. But this rational logical approach did not appeal to Chiara at all. She had lost two babies already and she preferred to die herself than cause the death of her child. This can only be called heroic love. It is love beyond the ordinary. Most may not be up to it. But some clearly are.","Many, even Christians, will say she was wrong. She could have lived. She could have had more babies. She could have done much good. But she is inspiring to those who have absolute trust in God, who know with complete certainty what they must do. To one with faith like this, there are things worse than death.","You can watch Chiara and her husband, Enrico, talking about their decision on You Tube. What comes across is quiet joy. Of course, they would rather none of this had happened to them but this is the way they must follow. And in Chiara’s face and smile, we can see spirit at work. We can see the ‘spirit’ that brings life and joy despite the awful pain of our human situation. This can seem like complete nonsense to those who have never experienced it.","Our times need the heroic witness of people like Chiara Petrillo. We will soon have more debates about abortion and legislating for abortion. And seemingly reasonable and compassionate arguments will be brought forward. We need to be shocked into reality. The reality that young girls use abortion as “emergency contraception” and just to “check that everything is working properly.” We are more than our bodies. We need different kinds of checks that take account of minds, hearts and spirit as well! Chiara, who would rather die than hurt her baby, is a saint for our times.","","What I wrote in 2012 was true and is true!","",""]},{"title":"LET THE CHILDREN COME TO ME!","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

And these children were all under 11 years of age:","Dear God, are you really invisible? I’d like to meet you but it would be strange if I can’t see you. Was Jesus really your son or did you just tell him what to say? Do you get angry when I’m naughty? I’ll try to be good. That’s everything for now. Yours sincerely, Barney","Dear God, how many angels are there in heaven? Do people become angels when they die or are angels different from people? Does everyone go to heaven or only good people? Do you mind when people don’t believe in you? I don’t think my father believes in you, but I know you are real. I hope he will be able to go to heaven too. All the best, Anne","Dear God, why did the father like the prodigal son better than his brother? Do you like good people better if they do some sins first? Alan","Dear God, why aren’t you friends with the devil? My teacher says he used to be an angel. Did you have an argument? When we argue at school our teacher makes us say ‘sorry’. Would you let him back if he said sorry? Maybe then he wouldn’t do all those bad things. Thank you, Beth.","Children, fresh from God, are so refreshing, so wise, so honest and open. They also think deeply about things. They want to know things. They want to understand. They wear you out with their why, why, whys! That’s probably why in the gospel, you remember, the disciples wanted to send them away. They thought they were doing a good thing in protecting Jesus; that he was already worn out from all the demands made on him. But Jesus wasn’t one bit pleased and he said, “No, let the little children come to me, for it is to such as these that the kingdom of heaven belongs.” A way of saying: “These children are not a nuisance. Far from it! They’re closer to God than anyone here!” No one was ever a nuisance to Jesus. He was never too tired, never too busy to give of himself and his time to anyone who needed it.","That same Jesus constantly gives himself to us, to be nourishment and medicine for our souls and bodies.  Communion was never meant to be a kind of reward for being good or for living a good life. It is much more like the spiritual medicine we need because we’re weak and fragile.","We just can’t live a Christian life without Christ!","",""]},{"title":"O Happy Fault!","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 25th June 2017","","","","I love what we sing at the Easter Vigil: “O Happy fault, O necessary sin of Adam, which gained for us so great a Redeemer.” Isn’t that’s the best ‘good news’ you could ever hear – that a fault could be happy, that a sin could be \nnecessary. Wouldn’t you wish you knew that when you were young and always seemed to be doing the wrong thing instead of the right thing? How great to be able to say, “O, but this is a happy fault; this is a necessary sin!”","I also love this letter to God written by a young girl called Beth: “Dear God, why didn’t you tell Eve not to trust the snake? Then she wouldn’t have eaten that stupid apple. Did you secretly want her to eat it? Yours sincerely, Beth.”","What a marvellous question! What wisdom in a young child!  How poor and deprived we would be if we couldn’t see God in the human flesh and blood of Jesus! What a happy outcome from such a happy fault!","We heard about the Original Sin or the Fall very early in life. It was seen as the beginning and cause of all the other sins down the ages. We were not to blame for it but we inherited the results of it. What we call the Fall (Genesis 3) is not something that happened in one historical moment to Adam and Eve. It’s something that happens in all moments and all lives. It must happen and will happen to all of us. The English mystic Julian of Norwich said, “First the fall, then the recovery from the fall, and both are the mercy of God.” It is in falling down that we learn almost everything that matters spiritually. As many of the parables seem to say, you have to lose it (or know you don’t have it) before you can find it and celebrate it. (Luke 15).","Did you get round to googling ‘Garvan Byrne’ at Easter time? Garvan was born on 20th March 1973 with a very rare kind of fatal bone marrow disease with the result he didn’t grow after five years of age. So his words of wisdom, which would have been remarkable coming from an adult, were all the more extraordinary because they seemed to be coming from a five year old child!  He died 16th April in 1985, just two months after a video was made of an interview with him. His mother marvelled at his deep faith and peace in facing suffering and death. She admitted so honestly that she couldn’t explain where his strength and peace came from.  She also said she would love to have what he had. “I’m searching for it,” she said, “I want it, but I still haven’t got it.”","It’s what we are all longing for, searching for often without full realizing it. “Like the deer that yearns for running streams, so my soul is yearning for you, my God.”","","",""]},{"title":"We Worship A Suffering God","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 18th June 2017","","","","Many people question how there can be a good or just God in the presence of so much evil and suffering in the world—about which God seems to do nothing. Why doesn’t God intervene? Why doesn’t God do something about it?","Richard Rohr suggests one way of answering these questions. Jesus is the living “image of the invisible God” (Colossians 1:15). In him we see that God, in some very real way, is suffering with us. God is not watching it, but in it! How else can we understand the revelation of the cross and that our central Christian image is a naked, bleeding, suffering man? Christians worship a suffering God, maybe without fully realizing it.  And St. Paul says we all share in this, that we “make up in our own bodies all that still has to be undergone for the sake of the Whole Body (Colossians.1:24).","We need to see that Jesus is not observing human suffering from a distance. He is in human      suffering with us and for us. In Jesus we see that God uses tragedy, suffering, pain, betrayal, even death itself, not to wound us but in fact to bring us to God. On the cross, God took the worst thing, the killing of God, and made it into the best thing—the\n redemption of the world! If you gaze upon the mystery of the cross long enough, you realize that God uses the bad for good. At the cross you learn humility, patience, and compassion. Sooner or later, life is going to lead us (as it did Jesus) into a place where we can’t fix, control, explain, or understand. Usually this has to be very concrete and personal and not mere theory. That’s where transformation most easily and deeply happens. That’s when we’re uniquely in the hands of God because we cannot “handle” it ourselves.","It’s so easy to talk about the theory of all this but 34 year old Colette Nolan, originally from Newbridge, who has a rare form of cancer and nearly died last Christmas, has learned to live it before she talked about it. She has learned through desperate pain, darkness and near despair and this is how she explains it: “Cancer can heal your life if you let it. It will bring you to the depths of your being and test you to see if you really want to be here on this earth. If you decide to stay (and there’s always a choice) then that comes with a responsibility. The responsibility is to take your health into your hands and to share with the world how you did it. You will feel the extreme highs and lows of every single emotion possible. You will have to face grief for all that cancer changes in you, but you can also feel such joy at being alive. Life becomes so precious and every single moment feels worthy of exquisite poetry. You will suddenly notice the birds circling in the sky at sunset or the little robin that appears each morning. You will never take anything for granted again.”","Suffering is the only thing strong enough to destabilize the imperial self in all of us. It has to be led to the edge of its own resources, so it learns to call upon its Deepest Source. And nothing else can compare with this discovery. As Jesus said: “Whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it” (Luke 9:24).","","",""]},{"title":"At Home with Mystery","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 11th June 2017","","","You don’t need me to tell you we are complex, complicated people, full of contradictions. We can see this so clearly in other people but we are not so good at seeing it in ourselves. We can be blind to our own contradictions. I’m sure you’ve sometimes said of someone, “He’s like two different people – I wonder who we’re going to meet today?” I heard too of a very fine lecturer who was always lecturing about the importance of relationships and community yet those who lived with him said he kept himself to himself and rarely spoke a word to anyone! He was good at the theory! And I used be surprised to find that those who caused the most trouble in family or community were the first to lecture others from on high! But I’m not surprised any more because we’re all inclined to tackle in talk what we can’t tackle in life. It’s a kind of compensation! But the little lad in “Angela’s Ashes” probably explains it best: “I think my father is like the Holy Trinity, the one that comes in with the paper in the morning, the one at night with the stories and the prayers, and then the one who does the bad thing and comes in with the smell of whiskey and wants us to die for Ireland!”","All this shows we are a mystery even to ourselves. We often don’t understand our own behaviour and we bewilder those who love us and want to understand us. Remember how honest St. Paul was about this: “I don’t understand my own behaviour. The good things I want to do I don’t do and the evil things I don’t want to do, I do. What a wretched man I am.” (Rom.7:15, 24)","Really then, we can’t complain when confronted today with the mystery of God as Trinity; in fact we should feel at home there. We’re never going to understand this mystery of our Faith but it does throw a warm light on the mystery of our own lives. If, in some way, God is a family of loving relationships and some way relationship is at the heart of God, then no wonder relationship is at the heart of our lives too. Only in relationship have we any hope of coming to know who we are. Relationship is at the heart of family, at the heart of church and at the heart of parish. It is the quality and strength of the relationships in a group that make all the difference, not the planning or the management or the administration. All these help, of course, but if the relationships are not right, nothing will be right.","I have a strange feeling I’m now doing what I said above – tackling in talk what I find hard to do in life. No wonder, too, I’m so consoled by almost the very last words in the medieval treatise called “The Cloud of Unknowing”:","“What God sees with his compassionate eyes is not how we are or how we have been but how we long to be”","","",""]},{"title":"Pentecost and St. Charles","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 4th June 2017","","","There’s a lovely simple story that I’m sure I told you before but it’s worth repeating. It’s about a young ocean fish swimming around everywhere looking for the ocean. He decides to consult an older, more experienced fish about this problem. The older fish is very surprised and says, “But this is the ocean, you’re in it, it’s all around you, you couldn’t live without it!” The young fish is very disappointed with this answer and says, “No, this is just water! I’m looking for the ocean!” And off he swims, still the looking for the ocean.","Now, as the fish is in the ocean, so are we in God.  Just as the fish is in the ocean and needs the ocean to survive so we are in God: “In him we live and move and have our being”, as St. Paul says. We could say, “In him we swim!” Needless to say, when we try to talk about God or God’s spirit, our words and images are inadequate and very limited, but some are better than others.","At one time, I imagined God’s spirit inside me, safely locked inside me like Jesus in the tabernacle. The scriptures do speak about God coming and making his home with us, and about God’s spirit being poured into us! But that sounds like I have God’s spirit instead of God’s spirit having me which is very different. God’s Spirit which may carry me in ways I’d rather not go. This is a far better image. God is our ocean in whom we live and move and have our being.","This is true whether we’re aware of it or not. But what those who knew St. Charles remembered most about him was that this was so real to him. God was more real to him than anything or anyone else. He seemed to be able to live all the time aware of God’s presence. Fr. Wilfred, who knew him and preached at his funeral, said: “All who knew him never knew him to be without prayer, night and day. I almost think he prayed in his sleep. He prayed always.”","As well as water and fire, air or wind is another great symbol of God’s spirit and these, you notice, are all sources of energy and power. Everywhere on our mountains now there are wind turbines harnessing the power of the wind. And, if I may brag a little, long ago at home when we were children, we were the first in our area to have electricity. How come? Because my father set up our own wind turbine in the back garden! We called it a wind charger, so when the wind was strong we had great light and energy but, when the wind was weak, we had to go back to the oil lamps!","With God’s spirit, we never have that problem; the power is always strong and constant. The only problem is how we harness this energy. As believers, we know this power is there for us but we must want it, plug into it and positively claim it day after day. The sacraments are one way we link into this power. Prayer is another, a prayer of gratitude that we can breathe deeply of God’s Spirit. So, this Pentecost day, and every day, let’s plug into the power and energy of God’s Spirit as we pray:","“Come, Holy Spirit, fill the hearts of your faithful and enkindle in them the fire of your love.”","",""]},{"title":"Being carried","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 28th May 2017","","","Today Jesus is “carried up to heaven” (Luke 24: 52.)  And where he has gone we hope to be carried too. But what is it about ‘being carried’ that touches such deep and powerful emotions within us? Is it that coming into life we were carried for nine long months in our mother’s womb? Or have we memories of hearing that someone ‘had to be carried home’? Or do we dread the day we will no longer be independent or mobile and have to be carried?","","I remember, as a child, being carried on the bar of my father’s bicycle, how often I don’t know but I know it left indelible impressions that I carry to this day. I remember being surrounded by his warmth and energy; I remember feeling so safe and secure and, strange though it may seem, I remember an awareness of the extra effort and energy needed to carry me, small though I was!","","Much later in life I read how Pope John XX111, when carried into St. Peter’s on the Sedia Gestatoria, was moved to remember how he was once carried on his father’s shoulders at some religious ceremony in his childhood and this led him to say, “The secret of everything is to allow the Lord to carry us and to carry the Lord to others.”","‘To be carried’ sounds easy and attractive; you don’t have to do anything – just allow yourself to be carried! But it’s not one bit easy; it takes great trust; it’s like lying back on the ocean and trusting you won’t drown! It means trusting you’ll be carried to a good place. Even as a child on the bar of the bike, part of me wanted to be doing the cycling myself instead of being carried! And I think we were definitely trained and educated more in giving than in receiving. For many of us, it is far easier to carry than to be carried. It is far easier to carry the Lord to others than to allow ourselves to be carried by the Lord or anyone!","","Just now I am more conscious of all this than ever before because during my recent break in beautiful Dingle, I had an unexpected and unwanted break! I tripped and fell on a hard concrete footpath and damaged my right elbow and shoulder with the result I couldn’t do so many ordinary things like driving, tying my laces or cutting a piece of bread! I have to do everything with my left hand so slowly and patiently. I have to allow myself to be helped. And while everyone is so helpful and kind, I don’t want to be too dependent or put burdens on people already burdened enough. Neither do I want to be too independent. It’s so difficult to get a happy balance between these two, isn’t it? I love, and I’m sure we all love, the image of the Good Shepherd carrying the lost sheep home on his shoulders. At the same time, we don’t want to be lost or need to be carried just yet, do we? But maybe we’re just too inclined to fancy ourselves in the Jesus role and the ‘carrying’ role and fail to see that, in so many ways, we’re just as lost and needy as those we want to carry.","","It’s good to carry, of course it is; it’s good to serve, of course it is; but equally it’s good and necessary to be able to graciously receive the help we need as we encourage one another on our pilgrim path. Oh, and be sure to watch that path!","","",""]},{"title":"The Gift of the Spirit","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 21st May 2017","","","","Sometimes, when we think we’re so bright and so right, we get it all wrong. Then at other times, we know things in our hearts with a deep conviction and we can’t explain how we know.","I vividly remember one time when I thought I was right and bright but got it so wrong. It was at our church at the Graan in Enniskillen many years ago. People used come there every day from far and near for confessions and blessings. One day I was very impressed by an old woman who had come the whole way from Omagh, using two buses, one from Omagh to Enniskillen and the other from Enniskillen out to the Graan. So I told her, if it would help, I could arrange a lift for her back into town. And she was very happy with that. So, when the next person came for confession, I thought I had a really bright idea. It was the old style confession box so I couldn’t see the man but he sounded very normal and when he’d made his confession, I said to him, “You know we normally ask you to say some prayers as a penance but, this evening, I wonder could you to do something practical instead?” I first checked on whether he was going into town and explained about the old lady from Omagh and asked him would he mind giving her a lift into town. Well, as I said, he seemed normal enough up to that point but then he began to stutter and stammer and eventually blurted out, “And that’s me penance?” And I said, “Well, look, you don’t have to do it, if it’s a problem. I just thought you wouldn’t mind.”","“Well, indeed, Father,” says he, “I don’t mind. Sure, I’ll do it if you want me to, but I think it’s only fair at the same time to tell you that I’m on a bike!” It had never entered my head. But I was so glad he spoke up. For everyone’s sake!                                                                                 Many things like that happened over the years but also many times I’ve known things in my heart with a deep conviction and didn’t know how I knew! When I read what the great Karl Rahner wrote, or Newman, I found myself thinking, “But, somehow, I’ve always known that; I’ve always felt that.” And I felt sure it was learned not from human teachers or from books but directly from God’s Spirit working within. And that’s not boasting because God’s Spirit is working in every human heart.  And that’s what Jesus is promising us in the gospel to day. He will not leave us orphans; we will have the gift of his Spirit to sustain us. God’s spirit is at work in every life and every human heart, alerting us to what gives life and what doesn’t, to what is true and what is false. And when I say every human heart I mean every human heart – not just Catholic hearts or Christian hearts. As Christians, we are blessed in that we have more chance of recognising what is going on, more chance of recognising how God is leading us and educating us in the ordinary events and experiences of life. And this is not something I’ve dreamt up or invented! St Thomas Aquinas says God teaches us though grace in the depths of the human heart and mind. And Pope John Paul 2 explained it this way: “Since salvation is offered to all, it must be made concretely available to all, including those who have no opportunity to know the Gospel.” “In a manner known only to God”, he says, “The Spirit offers this possibility to everyone through ‘grace secretly at work’ in their hearts.”  (Redemptoris Missio)"]},{"title":"The Way of Unknowning","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 14th May 2017","","","","We were told in Primary School that we were here on earth to know, love and serve God in this life and then to enjoy him in heaven for all eternity. This was when we were just getting used to being here and before we even wondered why we were here. We were given lots of answers to questions we didn’t yet have! If I could float back in time to that classroom with the understanding I now have, I could respectfully say, “Well, excuse me, but knowing God is problematic because Karl Rahner says that the variety of ways the writers present God in the New Testament, the phrases and images they use, all show how inadequate all human ideas and images are when trying to express who God is. And away back in the fourth century, St. Augustine said “If you think you know and understand God, it’s not God you know.” And St. Thomas Aquinas suggests that the only thing we can say about God is what God is not.” So, why didn’t they just tell us that God is a great beautiful mystery that no human words can describe? And that this great beautiful God created us and loves us. Children, fresh from God, feel completely at home in the world of wonder and mystery.","I was very happy when I discovered, many years ago, that there was a tradition of spirituality called the ‘Way of Unknowing’. This tradition says God is greater than any language we might use to speak of God. We cannot lay hold of God by way of concept, language or experience because God is ultimately beyond human comprehension. St. John Cassian defined contemplative prayer as an imperfect yet “astonished gaze at God’s ungraspable nature, something hidden from human sight.”  At the same time, this tradition has used a few lean landscape images to challenge the very use of images! These include the desert, the mountain and the cloud, used to question the overconfidence in words that sometimes characterises the study of theology.","Desert and mountain terrain confront us with our human limits, with how puny, small and unimportant we really are. Stand on Skellig Michael, that great fortress of rock off the coast of Kerry and you will be aware of the tiny speck you are on this great rock which is itself hardly even a speck in the vastness of the ocean. It is wild, fearful and overwhelming. And then the image of the cloud: The14th Century mystic who wrote ‘The Cloud of Unknowing’ put it this way: “You are to smite (to strike, to attack) that thick cloud of unknowing with a sharp dart of longing love.” But loving God is also problematic. What does it mean? St Paul, in all his writings talks very little about our love of God and much more about God’s love for us. And if we can come to believe and bask in God’s love shining on us, then our love of God is some kind of responding gratitude and amazement, wonder and joy! And, of course, our human brother, Jesus, is the best word, the living word that helps us begin the adventure of coming to know and love the living God, an adventure that has no ending!","“Our intense need to understand will always be a powerful stumbling block to our attempts to reach God in simple love, and must always be overcome.”(The Cloud of Unknowing)"]},{"title":"A Spark of Divinity","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 7th May 2017","","","","Many years ago, I was walking outside Mount Argus here with one of our students. I was wearing our Passionist habit; he was dressed in ‘normal’ clothes. We met some children coming home from school and chatted happily with them (which we wouldn’t do nowadays!), exchanging jokes and stories. Because of this happy chat, one of the little girls looked up at me and said, “You’re nice!” The student immediately asked her, “Why did you say that?” And she, without a pause, replied, “Because he’s a priest!” Then I asked her, “What about him, is he not nice, too?” And she said, “Yeh, he’s nice too,” “And why?” says I. And, quick as a flash, she replied, “Because he’s a man!” Out of the mouth of babes – the ancient dualism that has plagued Christianity down the centuries: priest and man, holy and human, sacred and secular.","Most of us have grown up with these unhelpful dualisms: soul and body, spiritual and material, church and world, with the understanding that soul is good, body is bad, spiritual is good, material is bad, church is good, world is bad! We need to rid ourselves of this false and misleading scheme of things that we have inherited. We need to fan into flame the spark of the divine in everything that God has created – and that means everything! In the story of creation, over and over again, it is repeated that “God saw that it was good.” And that includes us! In “Marriage Encounter” they used have that memorable phrase: “God doesn’t make junk!” He created us and he created us good and true and beautiful. But good people need a lot of convincing before they will believe this. And why? Because they have grown up with more emphasis on original sin than original blessing; more focus on sin and guilt than on their own goodness and beauty. If only we could take to heart the teaching of St.Thomas Acquinas when he says: “God is an artist and the universe is God’s work of art.” This means that every creature “can rightly be called God’s work of art.” He continues, “All artists love what they give birth to – parents love their children; poets love their poems; craftspeople love their handiwork. How then could God hate a single thing since God is the artist of everything?”","And God created us more than just good. He created us with a spark of divinity. With the incarnation, when God takes on our human flesh and blood in Jesus, this becomes more obvious. But it is simply making clear what was there from the beginning.","And every day in the Mass when the drop of water is drowned in the wine, we say: “By the mystery of this water and wine, may we come to share in the divinity of Christ who humbled himself to share in our humanity."]},{"title":"Heart’s burning","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 30th  April 2017","","","We are all stressed at times. It’s part of being human and being involved in life. I just wonder have you noticed what part of you is affected when you’re stressed. Is it your head (headaches?) your heart, (heaviness?) your stomach (knotted inside?) I know a bishop who told me when he’s stressed he gets cold sores.I knew a girl who, when the relationship with the boyfriend didn’t seem to be going anywhere, developed Bell’s palsy and depression. But when he popped the champagne and popped the ring and popped the question, the palsy was cured almost immediately! Amazing, isn’t it?","Something similar is happening in the lovely gospel story this weekend. The two disciples tramping home the seven miles to Emmaus were tired, heavy, stressed and depressed by all that had happened in the previous few days.  There’s probably not much chat. Their hope has gone; their dream has died. They had hoped Jesus was the one that would save Israel. But he’s dead. And everything has died with him. The dream is over. Maybe it was a foolish dream, a foolish hope?","And then Jesus joins them but they’re so down they don’t even recognise that it is Jesus. But he begins to open their minds and hearts to see and understand that it had to be this way; that there was meaning in all that had happened. It was necessary for Christ to suffer before entering into his glory. That’s what Moses and the prophets had been talking about all along. And, as they listen, their hope begins to flicker into life again until they are able to say, “Were not our hearts burning within us as he explained the scriptures to us.”","And because their hearts are changed, everything is changed. They’re not depressed any more; they’re not tired any more; it’s no problem at all to walk back the whole seven miles to Jerusalem. In fact, it’s the only thing to do! They imagine all the joyful chat on that return journey!almost have to! They have to share the good news! And just","All is changed because their hearts are changed. And their hearts are changed by the power of the word they have heard. They have been nourished by the Eucharist. They had heard the word on the road and they recognised Jesus at ‘the breaking of the bread’, an old name for the Eucharist.","In our time, we need to come to see all that is happening today in our world and our church (tough as it is to deal with) as part of that same story. Richard Rohr says the church was only an adolescent at the time of the Reformation (“We’re right, you’re wrong!”) And, at the present time, the church is only about 21! I like that.

Indeed he’s very like Jesus who was just a little older than Garvan when he astounded Mary and Joseph with the depth of his spiritual wisdom. So much so that the gospel says, “They did not know what he meant.” Garvan was born on 20th March 1973 with a very rare kind of fatal bone marrow disease with the result he didn’t grow after five years","of age. So his words of wisdom, which would have been remarkable coming from an adult, were all the more extraordinary because they seemed to be coming from a five year old child!  He died at this time of year, 16th April in 1985, just two months after a video was made of an interview with him.","He was interviewed at Helen House in Oxford by Sr. Frances Dominica. If she had not made this video we would probably never have heard of Garvan and what a loss that would have been. His mother speaks briefly on the recording but so honestly and beautifully. She explains how he was on anabolic steroids in his early years but was taken off them at five years and from then on he was a very different child, grasping things in a very mature way and with extraordinary inner strength. How did he have such strength and peace, she asks, where did it come from? She admits she can’t answer those questions. She herself would love to have what he had. I’m searching for it, she says, I want it, but I still haven’t got it.","Garvan talks about the joy of receiving Jesus at his First Communion. It was the happiest day of his life. Jesus is his friend and is always there with open arms ready to help him in all his troubles and he is able to tell Jesus his deepest problems. He thanks God every day for all the things he can do and he looks forward to meeting Jesus when he dies. It will be very difficult leaving his family but he knows Jesus will look after them and that, even though they won’t see him, he himself will be there in the midst of them also caring for them. (So just google ‘Garvan Byrne’ and let him tell you about his friendship with Jesus and share with you his faith and his hope.)","This is the joy and the hope and the peace we all long for.

Jesus was supposed to be their friend but he wasn’t there for the funeral. He turns up four days late! And Martha, being Martha, can’t hide her irritation. (You’ll hear it if you listen closely!) “Lord, if you had been here?” If! Why weren’t you here? When we needed you? Where were you? You’re supposed to be our friend!","This is grief speaking. This is the anguish of grief. She loved Jesus and probably wouldn’t have spoken to him like this before. But in grief everything is poured out!","And when Jesus says, “He will rise again… I am the resurrection and the life…do you believe that?” this probably irritated her too! But she responds honestly, “I believe you are the Christ” I believe you! As if to say, “I can’t understand all this talk about resurrection; I don’t know how it can be. But I trust you, I believe you.”","For most people, talk of resurrection is not much consolation at the time of death. “Eternal rest” or “perpetual light” means little to us at a time like this! In fact it can sound like perpetual torture! Anyway, it’s too remote and we long for immediacy. We want to be with those we love –now!","But we have to face the fact that death is horrible – all death, of the old or the young or the middle aged. It makes little difference. It’s the end of life as we know it. And as you search for ease, you may come on a reading that tells you, “Death is nothing at all…I’m just in the next room!” And you may think you‘re losing your mind! We are bodily creatures and the death of the body is not just getting rid of some baggage so our souls can sail to heaven! We don’t know ourselves apart from our bodies. That’s why we cherish the bodies of those we love and rightly so. We honor them.","When Martha said she believed and trusted his word, Jesus asked, “Where have you put him? They said, “Lord, come and see.” And Jesus wept. Why? Why did he weep? Surely if anyone believed there was life after death and a better life after death, Jesus did. And yet he wept. Why? For the simple reason he was human like we are and he was weeping for the whole human condition that he was part of. He loved Lazarus and his family and Lazarus had died. And Jesus’ faith in eternal life didn’t take away that pain. And it doesn’t for us either!","So, his tears were a way of saying: Life here has meaning too. Life in the little home at Bethany had meaning. All the welcomes and the cooking and the meals had meaning. All the work and the worries, the joys and the sorrows, all the messing up and cleaning up that is part of life has meaning. Life has meaning.","",""]},{"title":"We are not blind surely?","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 26th March 2017","","","","","Today, in gospel, we have the story of the man born blind. This reminds me of a young man I met some time back, who was born, not blind, but drunk! Blind drunk you could say! His mother had drunk a bottle of gin and he, the baby, was out cold for at least the first two days of his life! Not a great start in life, was it? But that young man impressed me no end with his insights into life, his own family, his mother, himself. He had greatest understanding and compassion for his mother.","I love this story of the man born blind. It could have happened yesterday, it’s so real. Who sinned, they asked Jesus, he or his mother and father? People in those times believed that when bad things happened to people it must have been because someone sinned. But Jesus said, “No – it’s not like that at all!” And when he is healed, the poor lad had little time to enjoy his new sight since they were all torturing him with questions. “Who cured you? How did it happen? Are you the one that was blind or do you just look like him?  Is this all a scam?” They bring him to the experts, the religious experts, the Pharisees. They should know. He tells them about Jesus and how he had healed him. And they say, “No, it’s impossible! If he healed you on the Sabbath, he was working and it’s a sin to work on the Sabbath! So he’s a sinner! So he couldn’t have healed you!” Then they quiz the parents, “Is he really your son, the one you say was born blind?” They are nervous and don’t want to get involved, so they say, “Ask him, he’s old enough. He can talk for himself!” And he sure can! He argues simply and brilliantly, “If the man were not from God, he couldn’t have done this. And he did do it. I can see! So he is from God!”","They are disgusted with all this. “Are you trying to teach us? And you a sinner! From birth! We’re not blind surely?” And here’s the nub of the whole thing – the nub of the whole story. This man who was born blind has come to see in two new ways – with ordinary bodily sight (which is not ordinary!) and with spiritual insight. He recognizes Jesus is from God and he comes to faith in him. The Pharisees, the so called religious experts, who just can’t think they could be wrong, are the ones who are really blind. And of course they can’t see it!","It’s the thing I dread more than anything – to be blind and not know it! And I’m sure I still am blind in many ways! Sometimes, when battered by life, we come to see things about ourselves that we never saw before, and even though it’s a moment of grace, it can be very upsetting. How much more do I still not see? After all the years? We can be brilliant, of course, in recognizing blindness in others but equally brilliant at denying and burying what we don’t want to see in ourselves. But it’s buried alive and so is affecting us and others. That lad who was born drunk was so honest about himself, and what he had learned from his own and his mother’s mistakes. He was so understanding of her and recognized her good heart and efforts despite all kinds of human weakness.","We can learn so much from people like that!

She lost everything she had except a few pieces of furniture but she and her children were immediately cared for by neighbours in the flats.","On Monday morning, she rang the Corporation many times but they seemed unwilling or unable to offer her any help. In her desperation, she decided to make one final determined effort to get them moving. She phoned from a kiosk along the quays and poured out all her anger, frustration and bitterness but could only get vague promises of assistance. As she left the phone box, a youngish, gentle looking man approached her. Why he picked her out of the hundreds of people along the city streets, she’ll never know.","Could she help him, he asked. Could she help him? She had nothing – her flat and all her belongings burned!","“Oh yes,” he said gently, “I know about that, I read about that in the paper.” There was something about him and the way he spoke that she liked. But she had only 50P. That was all she had till she got her allowance at the end of the week. But, stressed though she was by all her own troubles, she listened to his story.","He had been on the bus to Sr. Concilio’s Home for Alcoholics in Athy, he said. But all he had was 25P. He told the Conductor that Sr. Concilio promised to pay the remainder on his arrival in Athy. But the Conductor didn’t believe him and put him off the bus. The poor woman was doubtful too. “How do I know that you won’t go round the corner and spend it in the nearest pub?” She didn’t know; there was just something about him that she couldn’t explain and she kept wondering about afterwards. So, she gave him the 50P, all she had, all she had for herself and her children for the rest of the week! Remember this was Monday!","Then she noticed a parcel under his arm. “What have you there?” she asked. “Just some bread,” he said. “And you mean to say that while I’ve given you all I had, you won’t break bread with me? (She didn’t know why she said it and afterwards kept repeating, “Like, I’m not religious or anything but aren’t there words like that somewhere in the Gospel?”)","He seemed surprised and said, “Would you like some bread?”","“Of course I would!” she said. So there they were, two people united by their need, two people breaking bread together as they leaned over the Liffey wall.","A chance meeting, you would say. He probably asked many more before her. But was it? In the midst of all her distress – nowhere to live, dependent on the kindness of neighbours for the roof over her head – he comes along asking her to give him her last penny. And that became a moment of pure joy, a moment when time stood still, a moment when all the anger and bitterness drained out of her, a moment she never forgot!","“Like, I’m not religious or anything,” she kept protesting, “but was that Jesus?”","It certainly sounds like the Jesus who came to the Samaritan women in the gospel today asking for a drink of water and she certainly sounds like the poor widow that Jesus praised, “She gave all she had to live on.” She sounds like one of those that Jesus loved and admired, who didn’t think of themselves as being religious but who lived the gospel without knowing it.","",""]},{"title":"Let Your Face Shine On Us!","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

How much do we need this?","To the baby it must be very important that mother shines on him or her, and that mother feels this is the most beautiful and perfect baby that ever was born. And the more admiring faces there are, the better it is! In this, I got off to a very bad start because I can remember many faces looking in at me in my pram but agreeing among themselves that I looked like the sparrows! Well, that’s what I thought they were saying and only later when I was able to talk and complain about it, I was told “No, they were saying you looked like the Barretts” The Barretts were my mother’s people. This is my very first memory and I probably wouldn’t have remembered it at all were it not for the shock. But doesn’t it show that how people look at us is important to us from the very beginning?","Milan Kundera in his novel “The Unbearable Lightness of Being” describes four categories of people according to the kind of look they wish to live under. The first category longs for the look of a vast number of anonymous eyes. These are actors and celebrities and people like that. Being on T.V. is like oxygen to them; they suffocate without it. The second category is people who have a vital need to be looked at by many known eyes. They tirelessly plan gatherings, parties and dinners. They are happier than the first group because they can come up with the faces they need. The third category is people who need to be constantly before the eyes of the person they love. Their situation is as dangerous as the first category because the loved one cannot be, and will not be, always there. The fourth category, he says. are the rarest:  people who live in the imaginary eyes of those who are not present. They are the dreamers. They do things in the hope that the eyes of someone important to them will be directed towards them.","You may think this is crazy talk but we are more complex in our aches and yearnings than we will ever fully know. People of faith may be yet another category. At Hindu temples in India they tell you, “You come here not to gaze at God but to let God gaze at you.” And we pray: “Let your face shine on us and we will be saved.” Consciously coming into the presence of God or of Jesus in the Eucharist is prayer like this. If at mass or prayer of Adoration we can quietly sit before a God who loves and accepts us, we can relax and be happy here, now, in this place. We can allow God’s Spirit to instruct our hearts.  And it saves us from being locked into any of those four categories. Of course it takes trust to believe we are loved and allow ourselves to be loved.","It takes courage to accept acceptance!","",""]},{"title":"Work for Lent","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

But there’s a positive kind of emptiness that’s ready to receive, to welcome, to listen, an emptiness filled with awareness of other people and their needs. Trouble is I can be so full up already with my own concerns; my worries for myself that I’m not empty enough to be able to receive people and be truly present to them. I can be like an overcrowded bus, so full up with all kinds of things I can’t make room for others!","So, if you’re wondering what to do for Lent why not work on this positive emptiness, an emptiness that receives; an emptiness with open arms!  Because, strange though it may seem, those who complain most about the emptiness of their lives can be people whose lives are filled with all kinds of things. They dread space; so they amass more and more material things they can lean on. They dread silence even more. They don’t want to hear their heart beating out the seconds of their life. And death seems the ultimate darkest emptiness of all!","How might we work to achieve this positive kind of emptiness that God can fill with meaning? Well, first we need to clear out all the trivial things, all the rubbish that accumulates, all the escapes, all the preoccupation with our own comfort, all the unnecessary things that crowd our hearts and days.  People sometimes talk about their spiritual lives meaning the time they give to prayer or Mass but the whole thing is your human spiritual life – earning a living, cooking and cleaning, caring for the children or the grandchildren. It’s in our ordinary human lives that we live spiritual lives.","Our work, suffering and life experiences can carve out a bigger space within us, making more room for others. Leon Bloy puts it this way: “There are places in our hearts that do not yet exist and suffering must enter in there so that they may have existence.” Martha Beck and her husband, John, were Harvard Professors. They couldn’t believe it when told the baby they were expecting was Down syndrome. But that child taught them so much and Martha wrote about it all in a book called “Expecting Adam”. Needless to say, they had many times of confusion and frustration too, like every couple. There was one day when John couldn’t understand what was upsetting her and she couldn’t explain it very well but he just held her in his arms and she describes what this meant to her: “For a moment” she said, “I let the anxiety in my chest relax, let myself forget everything I had to do that day, let myself feel utterly safe. And then I understood that John was answering my questions even though he didn’t know he was.  This is the part of us that makes our brief, improbable lives worth living: the ability to reach out through our isolation and find strength and comfort and warmth in each other.","This is what human beings do.

July, 1960, two years before I was ordained and came across them recently in an old diary (I’m inclined to hold on to things!). If anyone has any idea who this Vincent might be, I’d love to know!)","“I can’t let today pass without recording the small window that was opened for me today into the pain and sorrow in one little boy’s life. He seemed a tough little lad climbing in one of the trees here (in Mount Argus). I was about to tell him he was trespassing (That’s what we were supposed to do!) when he opened the conversation by telling me he could also climb that really difficult looking tree. His obvious innocent delight disarmed me. His name was Vincent and I made the usual enquiries about what school he was in and what class. He blushed to the roots of his lush fair hair and said he was in class 4.B. I wouldn’t have noticed anything strange about this but for his blush of shame. Poor lad! He was far more sensitive than I had thought at first. He then started to pour out all that was in his young heart and my heart went out to him as I listened. He was only just beginning to have the life of a normal boy after spending six years in different hospitals but now at last he could play football, box and climb trees. And now, just when for the first time in his life he was a normal healthy lad, his mother has been in hospital for the past two months and is having a very serious operation tomorrow morning. What a weight of sorrow for a young lad to carry! I’m glad Vincent can climb our trees and so glad he told me his story.”","It’s so important to realise we don’t know where people new to us are coming from, man, woman or child. It’s so important to welcome each one with the same kindness and readiness to hear their story. It’s so important, too, not to judge people by their appearance, their way of talking or where they come from. And we must remember that when people do tell us about their lives or their struggles, we still don’t know it as they know it. It’s so easy to rush in saying, “Oh sure I know, I’ve been through the same myself, or worse!” Even if there are some similarities it’s not the same; besides, this is the time to listen to their experience, not to parade our own. I know it can be done with the best of intentions like reassuring them that we understand. My mother was always full of compassion for anyone in trouble and once at a family gathering when we were discussing the abortion referendum and the large numbers that travel abroad for abortions, my mother broke into the conversation and surprised us all by saying, “Oh, sure I know, I know! I’ve been through it all myself!” And we were looking at her in mock horror knowing she just hadn’t properly heard what we were talking about.","We can help others best by listening, not just with our ears but also with our hearts, because when we’re really listened to, we can see our problems with fresh eyes and see, too, the best way forward.","",""]},{"title":"Splattered With Blood!","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

Even the deer hadn’t ventured forth but remained huddled together under a tree. A younger one, I noticed, was exploring far from the group. The restlessness of youth! She kindly posed for this photo. On my return trek I saw this same deer lying very still in the long marshy grass. I became anxious. Then further on I saw what seemed like white flags waving through a screen of bushes. As I rounded the corner I came upon a man and woman acting very suspiciously. The flag, which turned out to be a large white plastic bag, was now lying over the fence. The woman was leaning over the fence, coughing and spluttering loudly. Both seemed embarrassed. I said ‘Hello’ and passed on till I came to higher ground where I stopped and looked back. I saw the man had climbed over the fence and was dragging something after him. Then it dawned on me – “Poachers! I knew they were up to no good!” How could I report this? There was nobody around – so unusual, winter or summer in Glendalough. “That’s why they chose this day,” I muttered to myself. So I decided to go no further, partly because of the bitter winds, partly to see if my suspicions were true. Only on my return did I notice the Ranger’s truck in a field nearby, the trailer full of bulky white plastic bags. Another dawning! It’s official! I’ve \nwalked into the middle of a cull! Further on I came across the same man and woman, only this time I saw she was splattered with blood. She started explaining that some deer were sick and had to be put down. I felt sick myself. How did they know which were sick? Only afterwards did I come to understand their strange behaviour. This was their job; I’m sure they didn’t like doing it; I’m sure they wanted to spare people like me from seeing these beautiful, harmless creatures being killed and bagged. I drove home seething and angry with humankind. We are eating up animal habitats all over the world. We regard animals as ‘game’ to be hunted for our amusement. Hunted to extinction! We rear and feed animals but only because they will eventually become our food. Seeing that woman splattered with deer’s blood aroused all kinds of emotions in me. No wonder they didn’t want to be seen even though what they were doing was legitimate. Then I turned to scolding myself for weeping over the culling of deer and not being angry enough about the culling of people all over the world in wars and killings of all kinds including the culling of those deemed defective and not worthy of life.","We have to be shocked into seeing things!","",""]},{"title":"“Leading Strings of Love”","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

But when small, we were only getting in the way of the work but do you know what he sometimes did? He tied strings to the handles of the wheelbarrow and I held on to one handle and my brother to the other and we were delighted. We were taking part in the work; we were involved and we were delighted! Fr. Karl, a Belgian Passionist, who died recently, drew this picture on a huge blackboard in Nairobi just after I told this story in a homily.","","It was many years before I saw this as a powerful image of our great creator God, who involves us in the work of creation, who shares his creative energies with us. Needless to say, all the power is coming from him but he graciously involves us. The great Thomas Aquinas says that in any making or creating, we are participating in the creative energy of God; it is one of the times we are most like God. And it’s also one of the times we’re most happy. It can be making bread or making music or making furniture or making stories – and of course the greatest making of all is what we call procreating – bringing a child into the world and great too is the work of helping to make that life meaningful, the work of teaching and educating.  How great too when we feel we are doing what we were born for; when we feel in our element!","The strings are turned in this lovely text from the prophet Hosea: When Israel was a child I loved him…..I led them with reins of kindness, with leading strings of love.

I look out that window every day. I notice the change in the trees, how strong the wind is blowing. It’s as if I can see time actually passing through the windowpane. Because I know my time is almost done, I am drawn to nature like I am seeing it for the very first time.” -Tuesdays with Morrie by Mitch Albom.","“These roses under my window make no reference to former roses or to better roses; they are what they are; they exist with God today. There is no time for them. There is simply the rose; it is perfect in every moment of time and of its existence. But we postpone or remember; we do not live in the present, but with reverted eye lament the past, or heedless of the riches that surround us, stand on tiptoe to foresee the future. We cannot be happy and strong until we too live with nature in the present, above time. – Selected Prose and Poetry by Emerson.","“I am almost serene. I can celebrate life. Below my window there’s an apple tree in blossom. It’s white. And looking at it instead of saying, “Oh, that’s a nice blossom’ – now, looking at it through the window, I see the whitest, frothiest, blossomest blossom that ever could be. The ‘nowness’ of everything is absolutely wondrous. If you see in the present tense – boy, do you see it and boy, do you celebrate it!”- Denis Potter: last interview with Melvyn Bragg.","“I was looking out my bedroom window to the east just as I was getting up at around seven o’clock and there were long bands of mist all over Sliabh Lucra, East Kerry, and for the first time in my life I had to look away because it was much more than beautiful; it was tremendous.” – Dreamtime by John Moriarty.","","Morning photo of a heron (above) from my window – probably Bertie’s grandchild!",""]},{"title":"Vigorous voice of joy","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

So I thought I would share with you these few words from the Acting Editor of the Tablet magazine. You can ponder them.","‘The Tablet regards disagreement, even sharp disagreement, in the household of the faith as a sign of life and vigour, not of disloyalty or confusion. We learn from those who differ from us; we reach the truth through argument between friends. It is of the essence of Catholicism that there should be no fixed register or final settlement. The teaching of the church is not a closed system; it does not tidy up every loose end or stifle every doubt. As Pope Francis said in Florence in 2015: “It is alive, knows being unsettled, enlivened. It has a face which is not rigid, it has a body that moves and grows, it has soft flesh: it is called Jesus Christ.”","Into a world of anxiety and ruthlessness, something beautiful is struggling to be born. That, perhaps is the story of Christianity in a phrase. While each of the five popes to have led the church since the council has contributed special gifts to its life and mission, in Pope Francis it has found a personality and voice to express the genius of the council with uninhibited conviction and charisma.’","","",""]},{"title":"Young in Spirit","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 15th January 2017","","","A young lad asks an old lady: “What is it like being an old lady?” She answers: “Well I have my good days and my bad days.” What is a bad day like?” he then asks. She answers: “Young man, a bad day is when someone like you asks me what it’s like to be an old lady!” What underlies this response? Isn’t it something like, “I don’t enjoy being old and I don’t like being reminded of it!”","This is probably the prevailing attitude in our culture towards old age. It’s almost regarded as a sickness in itself. In our community we like recalling one of our old men who said, “Old age is not all it’d cracked up to be. I feel I’m in a cul de sac and I’m going nowhere!” And the same man was always going places!  But the time will come for all of us when our activities will be curtailed, when we have less energy and can’t do as much as we once did. And, because of that, we can feel we don’t matter much anymore. Needless to say, this is not easy to face but the real tragedy of aging is if our spirit begins to shrivel up as well as our body and we isolate ourselves in a prison of our own making. Someone said, “Years only wrinkle the skin but to give up enthusiasm wrinkles the soul.”","All our lives we’ve been letting go of one age and stage and opening up to another. So yielding to old age and all the changes it brings is just an invitation to a new yielding and can be our greatest moment. Just as the highpoint in Jesus’ life was his utter and absolute helplessness on the cross. The gift is greater because there’s less of self in it. This can sound like pious talk or wishful thinking but it’s real. We’ve all known people who did yield and abandon themselves into the hands of the Lord and in the words of rhe psalm they were quite definitely, “still bearing fruit when they are old, still full of sap, still green, to proclaim that the Lord is just.” Ps. 91:13-16. We’ve known people who grew younger in spirit with the passing years, as they abandoned concerns and worries about passing things. Ken Whitaker, who died during the week aged 100 years, was definitely an example of positive aging. As St. Paul wisely said, “Though our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day.” (2 Cor.4:16) We’ve also known the opposite, people who are bitter and soured by life. I suppose a lot depends on our state of health and how we’ve negotiated earlier transitions in our lives. Cranky old people were probably cranky at every stage of their lives; it’s just more obvious in their uninhibited eighties or nineties!","Wouldn’t it be great if the old lady could truly say to the young lad, “My body is old and wrinkled but my spirit is young and bright”","",""]},{"title":"Poor old Charlie!","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 8th January 2017","","","","St. Charles died on 5 January 1893, and we celebrate his feast on that day. During the days following his death, enormous crowds of people came to Mount Argus from all over Ireland.  Fr. Eugene Nevin remembered that ‘for five days, “poor old Charlie” as he often called himself, had the honours of a lying in state fit for a King or an Emperor’. And it was said that more people came to his funeral than attended the funeral of the uncrowned King of Ireland, Charles Stewart Parnell, a few years before that in 1891. And it’s estimated that 200,000 attended Parnell’s funeral.","Only recently did I discover that Parnell was well aware of Fr. Charles. There was once a debate about him in the smoke-room of the House of Commons!  Well, not a debate but an exchange of views. Parnell was there and some members of his own party. He asked Mr. Peter McDonald, member for Sligo, had he heard anything about Mr. X, one of Parnell’s ablest lieutenants who had been seriously ill.  In fact, there was little hope for his recovery. Mr. McDonald replied “Oh yes Sir, he is much better and there are real hopes for his recovery. I am informed, Sir, that Fr.Charles from Mount Argus visited X last week and brought the relics of St. Paul of the Cross to the house with him, and I am told that since the relics were applied, X’s condition has greatly improved”.  Parnell’s first reaction was a half suppressed smile but he quickly recovered himself and said, “I believe, yes, I believe if a man believes in that kind of thing, then when he is very low, that kind of thing will very likely do him good.” This exchange was witnessed by Michael McCarthy, an anti-clerical barrister, who wrote about it in 1902 in a book called “Priests and People in Ireland”. He concluded that “If Mr. Parnell had succeeded in obtaining political domination in Ireland under the Home Rule Bill, he probably would have given Fr. Charles free play with his relics.”  McCarthy, despite his anti-clericalism, also admitted he himself wore a relic from Mount Argus for a while.","It was because St. Charles was so ordinary, so simple, so trusting, with a poor opinion of himself, that he could allow himself to be used by God; he allowed the Lord to shine through him; he didn’t get in the way. And he didn’t have the slightest doubt it was all God’s work. Really, we should design a great big stained glass window of Charles with God’s light shining through him!","St. Thomas Aquinas understood well the fears we all have that make us want to hide away but he said it’s sinful to be closed, to hide our light for whatever reason, to bury our talent. “God is in the human heart,” he said, “and God’s presence tends to spread from heart to heart as fire spreads over a field of stubble. We are most like God when we are busy setting fire to one another’s hearts.” As Charles did!","","",""]},{"title":"From Crib to Cross","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 18th December, 2016","","","It was while he was sleeping that St. Joseph had the most important insight of his whole life. I’m sure this is why Pope Francis has on his table an image of St. Joseph sleeping because when Joseph heard God’s will in a dream, he got up and put it into action. And to do that was far from easy. As we hear in today’s gospel, he was facing the greatest dilemma in his life. He knew about carpentry, making things and fixing things but he didn’t have a clue how to fix the problem he faced when Mary, his beloved, told him she was pregnant and that it was all from God. I’m sure he knew her well and trusted her completely but this was too much. So we’re told: “Joseph, being a man of honour and wanting to spare her publicity, decided to divorce her informally.” We’re so used to this sentence in the gospel that we don’t fully take in what Joseph was facing. The honourable thing, he felt, was to divorce young Mary but to do it as quietly as possible. Why? To avoid the shameful trial of a woman suspected of adultery. Can you imagine a more awful situation for a young couple at any time but especially in those times? But, difficult though it was, Joseph was sure this was what he had to do. Then, in a dream, he receives a message from God convincing him it was the wrong thing to do. Still, it must have taken great courage to act on it and face the future with Mary and the misunderstanding and criticism it would give rise to. I wonder did they ever tell Jesus about this awful time in their lives. I’m sure they did! And I’m sure too it was part of his learning, in a human way, about mercy and compassion.","Our own struggles and doubts and dark days are not all wasted if we too learn compassion and understanding for others in their doubts, in their loss of faith in God or church. We know that many of the great saints struggled with temptations against faith. As Paul Tournier said, “Where there is no opportunity for doubt, there is no opportunity for faith either.”  And Fr. Teilhard de Chardain wrote, “At the end of the day the only real suffering is doubt. If we could be sure there is a Jesus at the other side, everything would be easy.” Of course if we could be sure it wouldn’t be faith and it wouldn’t be hope. I know both St. Peter and St. Paul spoke of ‘sure hope’ as a way of describing their absolute trust in Jesus and Mother Teresa used say, “Jesus won’t deceive us; Jesus can’t deceive us.” Isn’t it good to remember too that St. Paul of the Cross and St. Therese  had no problem with people sleeping during prayer. They called it ‘resting in the arms of the Lord.’ It’s probably what they most need at the time. And it can be a good way of praying because God has a better chance of getting through to us than when we’re preoccupied with our own plans and programs. I’ll let Pope Francis have the last word:","“It was during Joseph’s rest and sleep that God’s will was revealed to him. In this moment of rest in the Lord, as we pause from our many daily obligations and activities, God also speaks to us. But like Saint Joseph, once we have heard God’s voice, we must rise from our slumber; we must get up and act.”","","","",""]},{"title":"It’s no secret what God can do","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters CP","Sunday 11th December 2016","","","I know from experience that I shouldn’t look at the Christmas TV ads. But somehow they grab your attention they’re so attractive and appealing. They play on your heart strings: lovely songs about home and ‘going home’ with scenes of warmth and family gatherings.  And in no time I’m drowning in nostalgia and I want to go home too; I want to be part of all this! Then the whole thing is ruined when it ends up signed by Tesco or Lidl, Spar or Supervalu. What has it to do with them? What have all those lovely scenes and songs to do with Tesco or Aldi?  Everything, it seems. Because if you were to believe them, Christmas is all about eating and drinking, so it’s also all about these big stores. I end up feeling seduced and betrayed in the same few minutes. And foolish too because it’s not the first time this had happened. I should have known better!","And it’s not just Christmas. We’re bombarded all the time by clever advertising persuading us where we’ll find the best deals and the best bargains. I don’t know why they need special feasts like Black Friday and Cyber Monday when the same persuasive tactics are being used on us all the time. At Halloween, at Christmas, then we’re expected to get excited about Valentine’s Day and that’s only an aperitif for Easter – all Christian feasts, you notice, but high jacked to keep business buzzing. At this dark time of year, you can feel mugged and laid low by it all, especially when you feel it has little to do with Jesus or his birth or his message. It’s so easy to end up doubting all promises of better times to come be they from God or man. Remember Isaiah promised that, with coming of the Messiah, swords would be beaten into ploughs and spears into pruning hooks and there would be no more training for war. Not much sign of that yet, is there? After all the centuries?","And, in today’s gospel, John the Baptist who pointed out Jesus as the promised one, now in the darkness and confinement of his prison cell, seems to be in doubt about him, “Are you the one who was to come or shall we look for another?” Or it could be that his disciples were beginning to doubt and John wisely sends them to Jesus with all their doubts and questions: “Go and see what Jesus is doing.” And Jesus’ answer comes back, “Don’t tell John what I am saying; tell him what I am doing. Don’t tell him what I’m claiming; tell him what is actually happening.” We too need to see and experience the difference Jesus makes in our lives. We need to plan quiet time this Advent when we can gaze on him and let his light shine on us.  Remember this old song: “It is no secret, what God can do/What He’s done for others, He’ll do for you/ With arms wide open, He’ll pardon you/ It is no secret, what God can do. There is no night for in His light, you’ll always feel at home.”","It’s not a carol but that’s the kind of ‘feeling at home’ we long for!","","","",""]},{"title":"Communicating Love and Tenderness","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters CP","Sunday December 4th 2016","","“It can only be to God’s glory for you to treat each other in the same friendly way as Christ treated you.” (2nd Reading today)","Pope Francis told this story that illustrates one of the most important aspects in reaching out to others, trying to bring Jesus to others, especially to our own family and friends: “A young man was suffering from severe depression. He lived with his mother who was a widow and did the laundry for wealthy families. He no longer went to work but lived in an alcoholic haze. His mother couldn’t help him but, before leaving for work, she would simply look at him with great tenderness. Today happily this young man has a position of responsibility and has overcome his problem and all because in the end that look of tenderness from his mother shook him up.” We need to recapture tenderness like that. It can achieve much more than all the scolding and all the lecturing in the world!","This reminded me of a similar story. It’s a story about a mother and her little daughter in Trinidad. They’re poor but the mother takes great care each evening to launder the well worn dress her daughter wears to school every day. Often, as the little girl leaves the front door to set off for school, her mother asks her to stop for a moment and says, “Just stand there. I love looking at you.”  This way of looking and loving we call contemplation! We usually think of it as our gazing at God. But we maybe forget that God is gazing at us in the same way that mother gazed at her daughter. Remember St. John Vianney asked an old man in the church how he could pray for such a long time and he replied, “It’s easy! I just look at him and he looks at me.”","Sharing our faith with others is best done by the same loving concern and not by forcing anything, not by arguments and certainly not by condemning them for their lack of faith. Fr. Gerry Hughes, S.J. said about his friend, Professor Donald Nicholl, that he loved conversation but ever since he first met him in 1981, he knew that Donald communicated in a mode beyond speech and words. From his eyes, his smile, his tone of voice, his gentle movements and gestures as well as his words, Donald communicated a sense of awe, wonder and delight in the mystery of life and of God at the heart of it all” I’m sure Jesus did the same. We have so many of the words he spoke and the stories he told but we don’t experience how he told these stories or the expression on his face as he found words to express all that was in his heart and in the heart of God. We are called, all of us, to bring that gaze of Jesus and the joy of the gospel to others. And to do it in the midst of ordinary everyday life. (See ‘Joy of the Gospel’ no.127)."]},{"title":"Stay Awake!","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 27th November, 2016","","Do you remember the story of the “Spotted dog bar”? It can be a shaggy dog story too! But I’ll give you the short version.  It’s about a very busy bar in a town in Ireland. Its owners, a husband and wife, don’t live on the premises but a mile or two outside the town. One Friday night after they’d washed up, cleaned up and locked up they drove home and fell into bed, exhausted.  But about 2 in the morning the phone rings beside their bed and the poor man nearly falls out on top of it: “Yes, what is it?” and the voice at the other end,  slow and slurred, says: “Are you the owner of the Spotted Dog bar?” “Yes I am, what do you want?” “I just want to know what time do you open in the morning?” And the man tells him. His wife asks, “Who’s that?” and he says, “Oh, just some drunk!”","At 6 in the morning, phone rings again. And the man answers, very annoyed. Same voice only more slurred: “Excuse me, sorry for disturbing you! I know you told me but I forget! What time do you open in the morning?” And the man roars, “Doesn’t matter what time we open because you’re not getting in!” and the voice answers, “Don’t want to get in. I want to get out!” And I can tell you the owner wakes up completely at thought of ‘your man’ inside downing all his whiskey! He’d have happily released him at 2 in the morning if only he’d known!","That’s what Jesus wants to do for us today. He wants to wake us up, shake us up into seeing what’s important in life and what’s not important. Not to frighten us but so that we can calmly and confidently face today and tomorrow, ever ready for the coming of the Lord! These ‘end of year’ readings do sound scary with all kinds of OT images that people then would have understood, warning of all the dangers to come. I feel the TV news does some of that for us nowadays, constantly telling us the dreadful things that are happening right now all over our country and the world. And people round the country, when interviewed, usually say things like “We didn’t think things like that could happen so close to us.” So, while of course we pray for healing from bodily pain and mental stress and from all the fears we have, it can also be helpful and healing to wake up to the reality that we’re not going to live forever. Some illness is going to carry us off someday and it could be very soon.","My sister hardly needs to read this gospel today because her grandchild, Dara, has already brought her this same warning. Some time back, he was very worried about his Nana because she has many pains and has great difficulty keeping the house clean and sparkling as it used to be. So he said to her, “When I grow up I’ll be an engineer and I’ll make you a robot to do all that work.” But then he thought for a while and said, “Of course you won’t be around then!  But don’t worry, Nana, I’ll help you during my ‘Transition Year’ – if you’re still here!”  Talk about being reminded of your mortality!  Jesus is doing the same today – waking us up to this reality so that we will be ready to welcome him when he comes:","Stay awake because you do not know the day."]},{"title":"I didn’t want to be merciful","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 20th November, 2016","","","We have been talking about the end of The Year of Mercy and the closing of the Doors of Mercy but, from God’s side, they never will. To help us ponder on our side, here are some reflections which are obviously not written by me:","“A few weeks ago my husband and I got into this huge fight. It was a serious fight that lasted for an entire week. I learned quite a lot about mercy in marriage during that week. I don’t know about anyone else, but when I ask God to teach me about something, he doesn’t infuse me with knowledge but gives me plenty of chances to learn and practice at whatever virtue I’m praying for. I asked God to help me be more merciful to those around me. Then this fight happened.","I didn’t want to be merciful. I wanted to be mad, and hurt, and to hold a grudge. I wanted to not like my husband. And believe me, I didn’t like him much throughout the week. But here’s the thing about mercy: nobody deserves it or earns it. I don’t deserve or earn the mercy of God when it comes to my sins and shortcomings, that’s for sure. It is very easy for me to accept the mercy of others when I need it, but the idea of being merciful toward someone who has hurt me? Well, that makes no sense whatsoever! That just seems crazy.","After a week of fighting and apologies on both sides of this fight, I had a choice to make. Either I forgive my husband completely and let it go, or I could hold onto my anger and hurt. I could be merciful or resentful. The choice was very clear to me. It was also very clear that I had absolutely no right to deny him mercy. If I was going to do that, then I needed to accept the fact that I had no right to ever kneel in a confessional again and expect God to forgive me my sins. When that became clear to me, I chose to let it all go. It was by the grace of God that I could just let go of the anger, pain and betrayal that I felt and could look at my husband as a human being who, like me, is trying his best. He isn’t perfect; who is? He will fail; he will fail me, and he will let me down, and I will do all of those things too. I have done it plenty of times and regretted it. He has always accepted my apologies and my attempts to do better. Now I had to do the same.","The moment that I chose mercy, I was freed from all of those other grudges that I had been holding onto for so very long. Spiritually, I felt a million pounds lighter, as though a huge roadblock between God and me had been cleared off the road. My marriage is in a really great place too. My husband and I fell in love all over again for no reason; we just like each other, and we laugh over silly things.  When Pope Francis declared the Year of Mercy, I never would have guessed just how much I needed to learn how to be merciful instead of always receiving it.”","This is something we all need to learn!"]},{"title":"Different kinds of blindness","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters CP","Sunday 13th November 2016","","","St. Charles died on 5th January 1893. But his presence and spirit and healing power are still here. One Saturday recently a young family came the whole way from Bunclody in Wexford to have their three year old boy, Colin, blessed by St.Charles’ relic. He has a form of autism. And one Wednesday a few years ago, as I was going over to the church for the 4 o’clock blessing, a lady already waiting at Reception, followed me out and gave me an envelope saying she wanted to give thanks to St. Charles for her own recovery from cancer and she also wanted prayers for a friend. I soon discovered what a mighty lady she was – and is! She is an eye surgeon and consultant and had founded a charity called ‘Right to Sight’ which was restoring sight to thousands of people all over Africa and India. I discovered too that she was from my home town and her Dad had been my mother’s doctor.  She is a deeply spiritual and caring woman who ran herself into the ground in her work. But her bout with cancer had taught her so much and she’d come to see things she couldn’t have come to see in any other way. She, the eye surgeon and specialist, needed a different kind of seeing! I told her about Jim who comes here all the time and who says very wisely that he never really saw anything till he lost his sight. For him, it was the start of a whole new inner journey that he mightn’t have embarked on if he hadn’t lost his sight.","Jesus healed people from all kinds of sickness, as we know. He healed people from deafness and bodily blindness but he was even more anxious to heal people from the many kinds of spiritual blindness.  I’m sure there have been times when you’ve come to see things about yourself or your family that you never saw before and you’re shocked at first: “How could I have been so blind? How could I have got it so wrong?”  And the next question usually is, “Oh my God (and it is a prayer!), how much do I still not see? How much am I still deceiving myself?”  It’s merciful if this coming to see is gradual but it can be another step on the way to real holiness.  This is a prayer composed by Thomas Merton:","MY LORD GOD, I have no idea where I am going. I do not see the road ahead of me. I cannot know for certain where it will end. Nor do I really know myself, and the fact that I think I am following your will does not mean that I am actually doing so. But I believe that the desire to please you does in fact please you. And I hope I have that desire in all that I am doing. I hope that I will never do anything apart from that desire. And I know that if I do this you will lead me by the right road, though I may know nothing about it. Therefore I will trust you always though I may seem to be lost and in the shadow of death. I will not fear, for you are ever with me, and you will never leave me to face my perils alone. Amen","","",""]},{"title":"A Constant Ache","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

Knowing he was dying, he wrote in his diary for 30th Jan.1997: The question occurred to me, “Would you be glad if you were offered the chance to be restored to good health of body but with the mind and heart that you are in now?” He knew he would be glad to remain with Dorothy his wife, and all the family, but that his heart and mind would ache terribly. Why? “Because” he said, “I have received intimations of what the “new creation” might be. I need to be bathed in the unconditional love of God which is heaven, plunged into the ocean of pure love so that my whole being is cleansed of my selfishness and my ego swept away entirely. I have a longing for that boundless love which would prove to be a constant ache if I were restored to bodily health.” He died on May 3rd. 1997.","In November each year we remember and pray for our dead in a special way and that is very good. But at times I’m very aware that they are way ahead of us. They have lived their lives; they have finished the race whereas we are still battling here below. They probably need, like Donald, to have their ‘whole being cleansed’ but he longed and ached for that. Yet we, simply because we’re still alive, stand by the graves of loved ones and think we’re better off than they are!  But where are our faith and our hope? They are with God and, because of that, more alive than we are! Do we not also ache and long for the day we will be welcomed into the joy of heaven. And reunited with God and all those we’ve known and loved on earth? God knows we say in every mass that is what we want but I suppose we also say, under our breath, that we don’t want it just yet. I know it’s natural to want to live a full life but when we have, wouldn’t it be just marvellous to ache for union with our great and beautiful God and all the saints and angels? Just as Donald Nicholl did? But he didn’t look forward to ‘resting in peace’. He didn’t agree with that at all. Donald loved quoting Aelred of Rievaulx as I did in my young days: “No medicine is more valuable, none more efficacious, none better suited to the cure of all our temporal ills than a friend to whom we may turn for consolation in time of trouble, and with whom we may share our happiness in time of joy.”  Donald was that kind of friend to so many and he intended to be as busy as ever in heaven.  He wrote on 22 March 1997: “One of the purposes of my keeping alive until now is to tell me that I shall have a vocation ‘in heaven’, acting as a guide for others during the last stages of their lives.”","","He’s certainly doing that for me!","","",""]},{"title":"The Slow Work of God","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 30th October, 2016","","“Little by little, Lord, you correct those who offend” Wisdom 12:3","When Fr. Andrew Kennedy, our Novice Master, handed us the Holy Rule many years ago, he said something to the effect that it was going to take us a very long time before we would succeed in living it, if ever! And I, in my youthful enthusiasm felt “Why is he saying that? Of course I will live it; that’s why I’m here! Of course I’ll observe the Rules and Regulations.” It didn’t take me too long before I discovered how foolish and naïve I was to think it was going to be no problem at all! But I suppose we need energy like this to get us launched! And, of course, living a religious life is much more than observing rules and regulations. But only gradually do we learn all that. Only gradually do we learn anything – especially the really deep, important things of life. And, as you know, Jesus was all the time trying to make his own people see how burdened they were by rules and regulations and that they needed to see that the law underlying all laws was the law of love. The law was love and justice and mercy. St. Paul says, “Before faith in Jesus came we were allowed no freedom by the law. But now you are all children of God through faith in Christ Jesus.”(Gal.7:22)","I introduced you already to Sr. Theresa Noble from Canada. She had been an atheist, a punk rocker, a vegan animal rights activist and teacher but found God again and Jesus and to everyone’s surprise became a nun, professed only in 2014. In her blog she wrote about how she began her journey back into the Catholic Church by attending Mass as an atheist, and she admitted that she received Communion in an unworthy state for almost a year. Finally, it dawned on her in one wonderful moment that she should go to Confession. She wrote about this to help illustrate the value of gradualness in the spiritual life.  Not gradualness in the law but in understanding of the law. This is a reality in all of our lives. We do not come to an understanding of God’s law or God’s word simply by reading a text.  It takes a long time for us to understand spiritual things in a way that goes beyond intellectual understanding and really sinks deeply into our hearts. Sr. Teresa was criticized severely by law minded people for writing this in her blog but she was just so happy she’d come to know God again, she wasn’t thinking of laws!                                                                                                         And certainly Pope Francis would understand that. He wrote in the ‘Joy of the Gospel’ that the Eucharist is not a prize for the perfect, but a powerful medicine and nourishment for the weak and he noted what St. Ambrose of Milan and St. Cyril of Alexandria taught about receiving Eucharist for the forgiveness of sins. And the prayers at mass sometimes talk about that too: “May the Eucharist we have just received cleanse us from our offense.” The Pope is simply retrieving some ancient Christian teaching about the forgiving, healing and nourishing power of the Eucharist. Fr. Pierre Teilhard de Chardain has written about the slow work of God in us: “It is the law of all progress that it is made by passing through stages of instability and that it may take a very long time.”","","",""]},{"title":"Saint Paul of the Cross","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters CP","Sunday 23rd October 2016","","","","Listen to this: “I am in great trouble. The Congregation is hanging only by a slender thread. I expect even more anguish and trials because that is the way it works. I have trouble eating and sleeping, but I cling to the will of God as tightly as I can.” That’s our Paul talking. We celebrate his feast every year on Oct. 19th.","Paul was a passionate man who fell in love with God early in life and his whole long life was driven by the desire to help others fall in love with the living God just as he did. He wanted us to experience God as he experienced God. And that’s why he could cling to God’s will despite anguish and trials, despite having trouble eating and sleeping. As he said, “That’s the way it works!” For all of us, coming to know and love God is much more like falling in love than knowing God through study or learning.","Like Paul the Apostle, our Paul felt he had been grasped by God, captured by God, maybe more like captivated or enthralled by God and lifted out of himself. He tried to describe this experience which happened in the summer of 1720 on the way home from mass at a spot still marked by a marble plaque. “In a moment of time” he said, he glimpsed the glory of God, the greatness of God, the goodness of God and the beauty of the living God, and all he could do was gasp with wonder. He was breathless with awe and wonder and reverence and the tears came flowing in streams. How else can you respond to an overwhelming experience of goodness and beauty? It touches your whole being. It’s no longer an “idea” we have about God or a study. It’s more real than all we call real.  It possesses us.","We Passionists sometimes smile when people mistakenly call us the ‘passionate’ priests or brothers. But it’s a happy mistake. We should be happy to be called passionate; we should be proud to be passionate about our God, our vocation, and our ministry. We wear a heart badge, as you know. We call it the sign – a sign of many things!","It can be a sign of the heart of God, the love of God, the mercy of God. It can be a sign of the heart of Jesus (St. Margaret Mary died in 1690 and Paul of the Cross was born in 1694 and devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus was spreading everywhere in those years.) The late Professor Owen Chadwick of Cambridge University said: “No evidence shows a direct link between the Passionists’ heart upon the robe and the development of the cult of the Sacred Heart during those years but it is hard to think that no connection existed.” But above all, in Paul’s core experience, this sign represents our own hearts, a sign that we carve the name of Jesus on our hearts, remember in our hearts that we are loved, that we find God in our hearts and teach others to do the same. St. Vincent Strambi, also a Passionist, said that God raised up Paul of the Cross to teach people how to find God in their hearts.  And that’s a marvellous summary of Paul’s life!","","May the Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ be always in our hearts!","","","",""]},{"title":"Tired confessing the same things?","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters CP","Sunday 16th October 2016","","","You say: “I hate having to confess the same old things over and over again. It gets me down and I’m afraid the priest will think I’m not really sorry if I keep doing the same things. I mean if I was really sorry I’d just stop, wouldn’t I? At times I feel I’m just weak and hopeless. And confession, instead of helping, increases that feeling. I know it’s not the right attitude but I’m having a hard time thinking of it in any other way. Can you learn to like confession?","I say: No, we’ll probably never learn to like it! It’s never easy to lay bare our sins and admit our pride, lust, anger, envy and all the rest. But in doing so, we are admitting we’re a member of the human race and those tendencies are in all of us. We’re admitting our human weakness and total dependence on God. I know we don’t like being weak or dependent on anyone, even God. But confession can also be a really helpful and encouraging experience. One man leaving our little reconciliation room was so happy he said, “Now I can fly! Better than Red Bull any day!” It’s an opportunity to talk about where we are in our lives and our spiritual aches and yearnings. Early on we might have foolishly thought we would get our lives together and be ‘nearly perfect’ in a few years but before long we begin to realise we’ll be battling all our days. One poor man said, “We’ll be battling till we’re a quarter of an hour dead!” In coming to confession we’re saying to Jesus. “Without you, Jesus, I can’t even begin to live up to the high ideals of Christianity.”","You say going to confession reminds you too much of your weakness and failures. But it also can be a humble prayer of gratitude “Lord, I thank you for your readiness to forgive me time and time again. Help me believe that you never tire of forgiving me and welcoming me back when I stray. With your grace these evil tendencies will never take complete control over me.” And why worry what the priest thinks? He’s more likely to be admiring your goodness and honesty and faith than thinking you’re weak or sinful. I know I come out of the Confessional marveling at the goodness of people especially when I have even a small glimpse of all they’ve to deal with and cope with in their lives.","I know it’s disappointing to think, “Here I am again. I don’t seem to be making any progress!” But sometimes we’re just annoyed with ourselves and it has little to do with God! God may not be fed up with me but I’m fed up with myself! I’m not the self-controlled and loving person I once thought I was! The ideals are getting me down instead of encouraging me to keep working towards them. Maybe all my efforts have been just been a cult of self-perfection or wanting to be a spiritual success. Others may want to be a great success in sport or learning or business. Was I on the success road too? It’s not about success; it’s about being faithful; it’s about humbly asking for mercy time and time again; it’s about knowing you can’t be a Christian without Christ.","“Those who live in the spirit of the gospel are not anxiously looking to see the results. They are not counting on success. They are not concerned by how much progress has been made. They live by faith, giving themselves over completely to God’s mercy.

Ignatius Waters CP","Sunday 9th October 2016","This was written by Sr. Theresa Aletheia\nNoble, FSP. I am sharing it with you because\nI think it is so honest, real and wise: “I used\nto be a little girl who loved Anne of Green\nGables, violin concertos, and writing stories\nabout fairies. Then I became an atheist punk\nrocker and later a vegan animal-rights\nactivist. After college I was an inner-city\nschool teacher, then a humble farm worker. Then, miraculously, a believer in God, a\nCatholic, a believer in Jesus, and after that — most shockingly to me, and everyone I knew —\na nun.\nNow, when I walk down the street as a religious sister, some people see the institutional\nChurch, others see someone on the fringe of society, others see an eccentric, and others see\nlove. I am all of these things in some way.\nSometimes I wonder if I belong where I am, in a habit, in the “in-crowd” of the Church. Will I\nbecome a misguided Pharisee? In what ways am I already a Pharisee? Will I stop wrestling\nand start nesting, just looking for comfort, acknowledgment, routine, ease, and pleasure?\nWill I, after all that I have given up to live this life, just be a mediocre religious in the end?\nI call myself a “former” atheist but that really is not the best label. I still am (and hope to\nalways be) connected with all of the things I ever have been, in some way. Many people\nexpect me to speak about my past as if I am terribly contrite and embarrassed. But I am only\nashamed of the ways I did not love God and others. I am not ashamed of the seeking, the\nwrestling, and the questioning. I am not ashamed of being eccentric and bold, an odd rebel. I\nhave not discarded my past, nose wrinkled, as if it were smelly garbage.\nI think it is important for us to see our sin as God sees it. He knows precisely which things\nthat may have led us to sin that will also, with the proper training, lead us to be saints. St.\nPaul was an overly zealous Pharisee, a rule-idolater and a violent persecutor. But much of\nwhat made him sin in the name of God was also what lent itself to his future holiness. Each\nof us has a unique gift to give others and the Church, and God often draws on the most\nunexpected aspects of our personalities and talents to do so.\nI found myself praying the oddest prayer the other day. “Dear Lord, I used to wish you\nwould cure my natural skepticism but now I never want you to take it away. I don’t want\nan easy, naive faith. Make my faith daring, bold, and unashamed but never take away my\nunderstanding for those who doubt. I always want to be united with those on the fringes of\nthe Church, those who find no understanding, those cast out of ‘insider’ circles, the\ndoubters, the seekers, the eccentrics, and the misfits. From a Church of ‘in-crowds’ and\ncomfort, deliver me Lord.”"]},{"title":"The Pale Blue Dot","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

Earth appears as a tiny point of light, a crescent only 0.12 pixel in size.)","","Look again at that dot. That’s here. That’s home. That’s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every “superstar,” every “supreme leader,” every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there–on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.","The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.","Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.","The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life.

Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 25th September, 2016","An old man once told me he was more ashamed of his sins than sorry for them! At the time, I thought this was very honest. Then I began to think about it. Where does the shame come from? And is it only those of an older generation who are ashamed of their sins. And is it a healthy response to sin and failure? I once heard Tom Murphy, our well-known playwright, being interviewed. He was born in 1936, he served mass in his local church, his faith meant a lot to him but there came the time when, in his own words, he had to rid himself of the idealised idea he had of himself that was tyrannising him! I wrote the words down at the time because I feel our well-intentioned education in the faith did that to many of us!","And especially to those of us who became priests or joined Religious Orders! We began at the top so there was nowhere for us to go after that, only down! Although, to be fair, I remember well when Fr. Andrew Kennedy handed us the Holy Rule, he said something to the effect that it was going to take us a very long time before we would succeed in living it, if ever! And in my youthful enthusiasm, I felt “No, I’m going to make a job of this! Whatever about the rest of them, I’ll make a job of it!”","When we’re ashamed of our sins, is this the reason? Is it because we fancied ourselves as being above all that? Not perfect maybe but on the way?  Is it because we let ourselves down? The self-image we had of ourselves shattered? Maybe it has very little to do with offending God or hurting others? Maybe our efforts at being good are a matter of keeping the books balanced so that God will have nothing against us? Maybe we’re trying to impress ourselves, or others, when we’re good or trying to be good? God is certainly not impressed by a business relationship of keeping books balanced! Is this perhaps the reason we’ve never experienced God’s love and mercy because we didn’t want to need it? We were nervously trying to keep on the right side of God so we wouldn’t need mercy or forgiveness.","If this is true, it’s awful, isn’t it? It means we do not believe the Gospel. We still believe what we believed way back in childhood: that we wouldn’t be loved unless we were good; that we have to earn it. It’s hard to unlearn this and really believe what Jesus is telling us all the time in the gospels: that we’re loved even when we’re not good. That’s great good news, isn’t it? If only we could believe it! And you know gospel means ‘good news’ and it is!  God loves us because God is good. Being convinced of that is the greatest incentive to keep battling on, not being shocked or ashamed that we still fail in many ways; not letting the great ideals of Christianity crush us instead of encouraging us. They are meant to be beacons lighting the way for us, gently calling us forward to truth, beauty and goodness.","St. Therese says, “Those who live in the spirit of the gospel are not anxiously looking to see the results. They are not counting on success. They are not concerned by how much progress has been made.

The big news they wanted to tell me was about their joy that once, just once, in all his 16 years he said to them, clearly and distinctly, ‘Thank you’. It was like a miracle. They marveled at it; they were so grateful for this one “Thank You” And later I remembered that Master Eckhart, the great mystic of the Middle Ages, wrote that “If we said only one prayer our whole lives and that one prayer was, ‘Thank You’ it would be enough.” Our great loving God would be content with that.","And then I came across this letter the mother of a Down syndrome girl wrote to a young girl with red pigtails who once, for a brief few moments, befriended her daughter:","“I saw you with your frizzy red pigtails and freckled face. I saw you watching my daughter… She was sitting at a distance from me watching the children play. I saw you smile at her. And then I saw you look up at me. My daughter has Down syndrome. She doesn’t speak and has some autistic tendencies. She doesn’t know how to relate to other kids. She sometimes doesn’t mind just watching others from a distance. Some kids watch this and ignore it. Some ask questions. What is wrong with her? Why doesn’t she talk? Why is she so mean? (If she pushes somebody away from her)","So I braced myself when you looked up to me. Because even though you look so sweet, I get tired of explaining about my daughter. It hurts every time I have to explain that my child has special needs. “Is that your daughter?” you asked. I said yes. “What’s her name?” And with that reply you got off the bench and went to sit beside her.","“Hi!” you said brightly. She looked at you, but instead of shrieking, she smiled back. You wrapped your arm around her. She looked at your arm and I stood up, expecting her to shriek now and push you away. See, she generally doesn’t like being touched. But my daughter, like me, sensed your beauty. Instead of yelling “nooooo!” she did something amazing. She leaned in and hugged you back. And laughed as well! And I sat down again. You were too far away for me to hear your conversation. But I saw you talking to my girl. And not caring if she didn’t reply back. I saw you both laugh. I saw her touch your red hair and smile. I’m sorry I couldn’t say ‘thank you’ at that moment. But, you see, I rarely see friends with my daughter. You gave us the most beautiful gift that day. You gave us a day where she was a typical child. Making friends and laughing. For that I will always be grateful. And I hope I see your frizzy red pigtails again. Next time I will make sure to thank you.”","Those parents were so overjoyed and grateful for so little or so it seems to us. Let’s pray today for children with special needs and their parents.

I am the sign of life and of hope. I was chosen for grass, trees, and leaves —without me all the animals would die. Look out over the countryside and you will see that I am in the majority.”","Blue interrupted: “You only think about the earth, but consider the sky and the sea. It is water that is the basis of life and the clouds draw this up from the blue sea. The sky gives space and peace and serenity. Without my peace you would all be nothing but busybodies.”","Yellow chuckled: “You’re all so serious. I bring laughter, gaiety and warmth into the world. The sun is yellow, the moon is yellow, and the stars are yellow. Every time you look at a sunflower the whole world starts to smile. Without me there would be no fun.”","Orange started next to blow her own trumpet: “I am the colour of health and strength. I may be scarce, but I am precious for I serve the inner needs of human life. I carry all the most important vitamins. Think of carrots and pumpkins, oranges, mangoes and papaws”.","Purple rose to her full height. She was very tall and spoke with great pomp: “I am the colour of royalty and power. Kings, chiefs and bishops have always chosen me for I am a sign of authority and wisdom. People do not question me -they listen and obey.”\n \nAnd so the colours went on boasting, each convinced that they were the best. Their quarrelling became louder and louder. Suddenly there was a startling flash of brilliant white lighting; thunder rolled and boomed. Rain started to pour down relentlessly. The colours crouched down in fear, drawing close to one another for comfort.","Then Rain spoke: “You foolish colours, fighting among yourselves, each trying to dominate the rest. Do you not know that the Creator made you all? Each for a special purpose, unique and different.  The Creator loves you all. Join hands with one another and come with me. The Creator will stretch you across the sky in a great bow of colour, as a reminder of all this and a sign of hope for tomorrow.”","","We are blessed and enriched in the many nationalities that make up our parish. There can’t be a beautiful rainbow at all until all the colours blend together and work together in glorious harmony.

Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 12th June, 2016","","","On my recent sojourn in Co. Mayo I visited the village of Lahardane which has a  memorial park in memory of the ‘Addergoole Fourteen’. They were the fourteen people from that area who sailed on the Titanic in 1912. All but two of them were drowned. Most evocative in the park is the ‘Addergoole Hearth’ which is made from stones from each of their houses. The symbolism of the hearth draws on a charming tradition from times past that when a family emigrates, leaving behind a vacant homestead, a neighbour or relative would take an ember from the last fire that burnt in that homestead on the last night that the family slept within its walls. That ember would be added to the neighbour’s or relative’s fire so that when the migrant family or a member of the family returned, their fire would never have gone out. It is in line with the theme of the park as a memorial to all Irish emigrants.","A plaque on the wall gave this explanation:","‘The traditional Irish Hearth represented the living presence of people in rural Ireland. The hearth was the heart of the family activity; from birth to betrothal, from marriage to Irish wake.","The Irish rural hearth was the centre of all productivity and creativity; the cooking, the drying of clothes, the curing of meats, nurturing sick animals, warming the older and younger generations, while stories, songs and news from a newly arrived American letter were exchanged.","To this day it is a poignant sight to see a cottage ruin or a cluster of abandoned cottages their gables set against the elements, their hearths empty and over grown.  They are a testament to monoculture, famine and perpetual emigration.","The hearth provided a place of refuge and hope for one’s neighbours and the embers remained aglow anticipating the return of one’s own.’","We are all emigrants and pilgrims on this earth and we gather each Sunday around the hearth and table of the Eucharist to hear again the story of Jesus and to be nourished and encouraged in our faith and hope as we journey together.",""]},{"title":"A Miracle of Grace","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 5th June, 2016","","","It was Palm Sunday 2013. Pope Francis was speaking to young people, who were gathered in St. Peter’s Square for the annual World Youth Day celebration. He said: “You are not ashamed of his Cross! On the contrary, you embrace it, because you have understood that it is in giving ourselves, in emerging from ourselves that we have true joy and that, with his love, God conquered evil.”","These were ordinary enough words, you might think, but they had an extraordinary impact on a girl called Carlotta Nobile.  She was following the celebration on television at her home in Benevento, Italy. She heard Pope Francis’ words and, at that moment, everything suddenly made sense: her illness, her suffering and her life which, at age 22, was already reaching its end. Carlotta was a highly talented violinist and a renowned concert performer.  She was a student of art history in Rome and in Cambridge and at Sotheby’s Institute in New York and the author of two books! And all at such a young age! Up to that point she had seemed to race through life.  “I am like a river,” she wrote in 2007, “that, in order to flow into the sea, always chooses the longest, most torturous road.  This is how my life has been: a challenge. And I think this is the way it will always be.”","When Carlotta learned she had cancer, she took on the illness as a challenge to be overcome. On her Face book page, she posted her thoughts and reflections, sharing them with the many people who were fighting the same battle, offering them help and moral support.  She wrote: “I found the faith and surrender, to believe that the cross of this terrible cancer is an incredible opportunity for growth, although sometimes all of us who have cancer know how hard it is to live with it. … The way I live with this cancer has become a unique serenity and trust. … And all this thanks to faith and our extraordinary Pope Francis … who says that young people should carry the cross with joy.” A priest in Rome wrote to Pope Francis telling him Carlotta’s story. Pope Francis then rang the priest to thank him and assure Carlotta of his prayers. So she then also wrote to him to tell him about her trust in life and her encounter with God: “I know that cancer has healed my soul by loosening all my interior knots and giving me faith, trust, surrender and an immense serenity right at the time when my illness was most severe.”","Carlotta Nobile died on July 16, 2013 at the age of 24. Everyone close to her — her parents, her beloved brother, Matteo, her fiancé, Alessandro, her friends — have become witnesses to her extraordinary trust and unconditional surrender to God in those final months of her life.",""]},{"title":"Who do you think you are?","paragraphs":["","From the desk of Fr.

We must not separate Eucharist in church from Eucharist in the world.  If we do, it’s not the Eucharist as Jesus intended it to be.

Ignatius Waters CP","Sunday 22nd May 2016","One thing the Holy Trinity teaches us is that relationship is at the heart of life, at the heart of family, church, parish and even at the heart of God. That’s why relationships are so important to us. That’s why it’s so devastating when relationships break down. God is love and mercy but even Pope Francis talks about a kind of mercy that is not mercy at all. He calls it ‘misguided’ mercy which consists in simply bandaging the wound without dealing with the source of the infection. There is need to deal with the root evil which leads to the bad behavior or to breakdown in relationships. Because God truly loves, he cannot smile benignly on all the awful things that happen in our world. That’s not real love or mercy.","I think this piece written by Meg Hunter-Kilmer needs to heard and understood far and wide. “Real love doesn’t sit back and watch the beloved destroy herself. Real love stages an intervention. Real love might shout or cancel the credit cards or go live with his folks for a while if that’s what it takes to help heal the beloved. Real love doesn’t accept sin, and it doesn’t pretend that sin doesn’t damage relationships. But even though God’s love might be tough love, he isn’t going anywhere. Even if you’ve run off, made yourself feel forsaken and abandoned, he’s waiting with tenderness. He’s longing to take you back, offering enduring love to heal your broken heart. Even if his silence in prayer makes you feel like he’s still hiding his face from you, he’s there.","The calling you have received is to freedom, to joy, to the knowledge that you are loved. But it’s also a call to action. You are called to witness, to forgive, to contemplate. You are called to love. You’re called to sacrifice for love of the other, even the stranger and the enemy.","If you don’t, even if you force God, in his mercy, to hide his face from you, you will remain his. But because he loves you, he may reach into your life in ways that hurt. He may break your idols and pull away your safety nets and force you to confront your sin. He may give you a choice: live for him or stop pretending. At times like those, we would do well to remember the wisdom of C. S. Lewis, talking about his Christ figure in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: “Safe?” said Mr. Beaver. “Don’t you hear what Mrs. Beaver tells you? Who said anything about safe? ’Course he isn’t safe. But he’s good.”","We don’t need a safe God or a nice God or a pleasant God. We need a good God, even if it hurts. Praise God that he sometimes withdraws so that his enduring love can transform us into the good people he made us to be.","","","",""]},{"title":"Wind And Water","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 15th May, 2016","","","There’s a lovely simple story about a young ocean fish swimming around everywhere looking for the ocean. He asks an older, more experienced fish, “Where is the ocean?” The older fish is very surprised and says, “But this is the ocean, you’re in it, it’s all around you, you couldn’t live without it!” The young fish is very disappointed and says, “No, this is just water. I’m looking for the ocean!” And off he swims, still the looking for the ocean.","As the fish is in the ocean, so are we in God.  Just as the fish is in the ocean and needs the ocean to survive, so we are in God: “In him we live and move and have our being”, St. Paul says. We could say, “In him we swim!”","Needless to say, when we try to talk about God or God’s spirit, our words and images are inadequate and limping but some are better than others.","At one time, I imagined God’s spirit inside me, safely locked inside me like Jesus in the tabernacle. The gospel does speak about God coming and making his home with us, and about God’s spirit being poured into us! But that sounds like I have God’s spirit instead of God’s spirit having me. A very different thing! And carrying me off in new and unfamiliar ways! This is a far better image. We are in God and the air all around us is our ocean in which we live and move and have our being.","So the air (or the wind) is another great symbol of God’s spirit as well as fire and water and these are all sources of energy and power. Everywhere on our mountains there are wind turbines harnessing the power of the wind. And, if I may brag a little, long before there were wind turbines on the mountains, long ago when we were children at home, we were the first in our area to have electricity. How was this? Because my father set up our own wind turbine in the back garden! We called it a wind charger and when the wind was strong we had great light and energy but when the wind was weak we had to go back to the oil lamps! How many, I wonder, can remember life without electricity?","Happily, with God’s spirit, we never have problems like that; the power is constant, always strong, always there. The only problem is how we harness this energy. As believers, we know and believe that power is there for us but we must want it, plug into it and positively claim it day after day. The sacraments are one way we link into this power. Prayer is another, a prayer of gratitude that we can breathe deeply of God’s Spirit.","","So, on this Pentecost day, and every day, let’s avail of the power and energy of God’s Spirit. “Come, Holy Spirit, fill the hearts of thy faithful and enkindle in them the fire of your love.”","",""]},{"title":"A Father’s Love","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

He’s quadriplegic with cerebral palsy and epilepsy and it’s the seizures that are the biggest worry. He’s completely immobile but, all in all, his condition is well controlled at the moment. He can get a lot of chest infections but we tackle them as they come. The help we’ve received from neighbours, friends and even complete strangers has been amazing.

Ignatius Waters CP","Sunday 24th April 2016","","","","","On 7th Jan. 1939, Einstein wrote a beautiful letter of condolence to his son and daughter-in-law, Hans Albert and Frieda Einstein. By 1939, Einstein had reached an age when, as he liked to say, the devil didn’t give one much time off. His losses, at sixty-five, were mounting: his wife dead, a step-daughter too, a son lost to madness, his own life uprooted and now lived in exile. His relentless battle to single-handedly save as many Jews as he could from Hitler, was lost as well. With the advent of war, it was impossible for Jews to emigrate from Germany. How, without belief in a personal God, he dealt with “all the difficulties and bitterness that the past years have brought” is the subject of this painful, realistic, and ultimately optimistic letter. It concerns a “blow that has hit terribly hard” – the death of his six-year old grandson:","“Dear Children, at such a young age you have been struck by the worst thing that loving parents can experience. This little boy had the promise of becoming a real man with a balanced and healthy outlook on life. Something joyful and sunny emanated from him. Although I saw him for such a brief time, he was just as close to me as if he had grown up under my eyes. Thus, this blow has hit me terribly hard, coming after all the difficulties and bitterness the past years have brought.\n But I believe we belong to those, who grow stronger and more selfless with every trial of fate. To remain benevolent towards one’s fellow man when one has forgotten how to expect much from life for oneself – this is what one should strive towards. Your short letter, dear Albert, has shown me again that you are somebody who can stand up to life in the best possible way. This knowledge comforts me a lot. Both of you will surrender to fate only through death. I press your hands warmly. Papa.”","Towards the end of his life Einstein wrote: “I am not an atheist. You may call me an agnostic. I prefer an attitude of humility corresponding to the weakness of our intellectual understanding of nature and of our own being.”","Even blessed with faith in a personal God, we would find it difficult to write as encouraging a letter as this!","",""]},{"title":"Please Listen","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 10th April 2016","","In October 1988 after the Beatification of St. Charles, I was sitting at Rome airport having just bought my duty- free, when along came the then world famous Fr. Patrick Peyton. Often called the Rosary priest, he was born in 1909 and died in 1992. That day, he sat down beside me and I was delighted because I had already met some of his relatives in Attymas, Co. Mayo. \nHe told me that, as an altar boy, he had thought seriously about becoming a Passionist. But some of our men came to give a mission in his parish and preached such terrifying sermons condemning the drink that the people brought in all their stills from the hills around and battered them to bits in the chapel yard! And he was a pioneer, he said, from that day to this! When I heard that, I pushed my duty –free a little further under the seat and tried to change the subject to the Pope! He’d been to see Pope John Paul for a whole hour. “What were they talking about for an hour?” I asked. Well, he said, all the pope wanted to  talk about was, what it was like when he was growing up at home in Ireland; what his mother was like, what his father was like.  And, of course, they were both old enough and wise enough to know that there is nothing more important than where you come from, the family that reared you, your father; your mother.","When we look at Jesus we see the rearing of the home in Nazareth. When we see his great compassion towards the outcast and the sinner, his tolerance towards other races and religions, his courage in condemning any kind of hypocrisy in religion or injustice in politics, we need to remember he learned all that in a human way at home and especially from Mary. From her too, he learned his humble trusting attitude towards God his Father. That’s what was outstanding in Jesus and that’s also what Elizabeth praises above all else in Mary: “Blessed is she who believed/trusted that the promise made her by the Lord would be fulfilled.”","","There’s nothing more important than where you come from and the family that reared you!",""]},{"title":"At the Heart of Christian Faith","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters CP","Sunday 27th March 2016","","","Faith in the Resurrection of Jesus is at the heart of our Christian faith. Without it, everything else collapses: “If there is no rising from the dead,” St. Paul says, “Christ himself cannot have been raised and if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and your believing it is useless. If Christ has not been raised, you are still in your sins. If our hope in Christ has been for this life only, we are the most unfortunate of all people.” (1 Cor.15: 14, 17, 19.)  I used to have an old translation of this passage that I liked even more: “We are of all people most to be pitied!”","Yet, I’ve heard good, faithful Catholics say things like “There must be something!” when people sensed from dreams that a far distant relative was ill. Or things like that. “There must be something!” they say. Meaning some spiritual reality that is beyond our understanding!  Though at the same time by no means convinced of it! Are we? Am I? Do I believe that Jesus rose from the dead? If I say I do, does it make a huge difference to my life? Or are we like those who experienced Jesus after his resurrection: “Their joy was so great they couldn’t believe it.” When people of faith are depressed, we take them off to psychiatrists and counsellors and maybe that is what they need, but do we ever think of asking: “Do you believe that Jesus is risen? Do you believe that we also will rise again? If you don’t, there is every possibility your spirit will be sick and depressed. To be a Christian means to be a witness to the Resurrection. It means we are people who radiate the joy of faith in the Risen Lord.","Why is the Resurrection so central? Because it reveals who God is. All scripture is revealing who God is, but the Resurrection of Jesus is probably the clearest insight we have into who God is and who we are. Why? Because it gives an eternal dimension to the love that God is. It shows that God’s love has no limits and doesn’t end in death.","Of course it’s good to remember that doubt is not the opposite of faith but part of it. If there’s no opportunity for doubt, there no opportunity for faith either! Even those like the Apostles who saw Jesus after his resurrection doubted. They saw him, they worshipped but they doubted. Thomas wasn’t the only one! St. John XX111, after the funeral of his sister, was heard to whisper: “Heaven help us if it’s all an illusion!” meaning all we believe about life and death. We know too that Mother Teresa had long dark periods when she doubted if there even was a God and, if there was, whether that God had any interest in her. Pierre Teilhard de Chardin in his retreat notes wrote: “Everything would be easy if we could be sure that there is a Jesus at the other side. At the end of the day, the only real suffering is doubt.” Isn’t it consoling that these good people struggled like we do?  We remember too that Jesus was very gentle and understanding with Thomas and the others but he did conclude by saying: “Doubt no longer but believe.” And he did say, “Blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe.”","HAPPY EASTER!"]},{"title":"I See His Blood Upon The Rose","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 20th March, 2016","","","Joseph Mary Plunkett  was an Irish nationalist, poet, journalist, and a leader of the 1916 Easter Rising. He was born at 26 Upper Fitzwilliam Street in one of Dublin’s most affluent neighborhoods. Both his parents came from wealthy backgrounds, and his father, George Noble Plunkett, had been made a papal count. Despite being born into a life of privilege, young Joe Plunkett did not have an easy childhood. He contracted tuberculosis at a young age. This was to be a lifelong burden. He spent part of his youth in the warmer climates of the Mediterranean and North Africa. He was educated at the Catholic University School  and by the Jesuits at Belvedere College in Dublin and later at Stonyhurst College, in Lancashire, where he acquired some military knowledge from the Officers’ Training Corps. Throughout his life, Joseph Plunkett took an active interest in Irish heritage and the Irish language.  The Plunkett family house in Kimmage was used as a clearing station for arms imported in 1914. On Good Friday 1916, Joseph, together with Padraic Pearse and Eamonn Ceannt came here to Mount Argus for confessions while the Seven Last Words were being preached. On Easter Monday, 1916, Captain George Plunkett, Joseph’s brother, waved down a tram with his revolver at Harold’s Cross and ordered on his volunteers armed with shotguns, pikes and homemade bombs. He then took out his wallet and said, “Fifty-two tuppenny tickets to the city centre, please!”    I loved Joseph M. Plunkett’s poem ‘I see his blood upon the rose’ long before I knew he lived so near Mount Argus and I like to think his proximity to Mount Argus at least partly inspired the writing of these beautiful lines:","I see his blood upon the rose","And in the stars the glory of his eyes,","His body gleams amid eternal snows,","His tears fall from the skies.","","I see his face in every flower;","The thunder and the singing of the birds","Are but his voice—and carven by his power","Rocks are his written words.","","All pathways by his feet are worn,","His strong heart stirs the ever-beating sea,","His crown of thorns is twined with every thorn,","His cross is every tree.","",""]},{"title":"Lisa Orsi (1992-2015)","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

This is part of what I said that day: “We meet Jesus in the gathering of believers. The tabernacle is empty today but Jesus is among us to strengthen our faith and fill our hearts with new hope. And we need that because the sudden death of Fr. Frank was a great shock to us all. But on the day he died, a baby girl, Lisa, was born in the McAteer/ Orsi family. So on that one day, there was death and there was life; there was great sorrow and there was great joy. A few nights ago, in John and Rosemary’s house, there was laughter and there were tears. It was like sun showers in the summer; it was an image of the whole of life. If we open our hearts to love and life we open our hearts to joy and sorrow too.”","This time last year, I noticed an article in the paper about a girl called Lisa Orsi and I knew the name sounded familiar but it still took time before I remembered when I first heard of Lisa: “Tragic Lisa Orsi collapsed while on holiday in Indonesia and later died in hospital on March 4. The 22 year old physiotherapist from Derry spent much of her time in Donegal and is now buried at Massmount Cemetery in Fanad. An inquest was held into the beautiful young woman’s death in Singapore. Lisa’s final hours were recalled at the inquest. It reveals how the physiotherapist had been visiting a volcanic crater a Mount Bromo. She returned to her hostel which was 6,000 feet above sea level and complained to her friends of having an earache and feeling unwell. Her room-mate revealed that Lisa was making some odd breathing noises. She was found the following morning lying face-up in a shower and had difficulty opening her eyes.","Lisa was taken to a clinic where a doctor found that her brain had swollen. She was then flown to Singapore General Hospital where she was diagnosed as suffering from extreme altitude sickness. The final cause of death at the inquest was given as a lack of oxygen to the brain. Her family gave the go ahead to have extensive transplant surgery so that others could live as a result. Lisa’s parents Dennis and Sharon, brother Jonathan and sister Shannon, all travelled to the hospital to be with Lisa in her final hours. Dad Dennis said he knew when he arrived at the hospital that things were not good. “I knew by Lisa, I opened her eyelid and her eyes were empty. I knew there was nothing there “Little did I know the full import of my words at Fr. Frank’s funeral, “If we open our hearts to love and life, we open our hearts to joy and sorrow too.”","Lisa certainly opened her heart to life and love and her organs had the potential of helping save more than 50 lives.","",""]},{"title":"Be happy about God’s presence","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

I’m only going out the back!”  In other words, even though he didn’t seem to notice, he was intensely aware of her presence.  And it was very important to him.  And only when it was broken in some way did he wake up to how precious it was:”Where are you going?”","Prayer is like that.  Prayer is simply being aware of God’s presence and being happy about it.  And when you know someone for a long time, there’s isn’t the same need for a lot of talk.  But there will always be the need for presence.  And awareness of that presence.  And gratitude for that presence.  The comfort of knowing there is someone there who knows you in all your moods; someone you can trust; someone who knows what’s going on with you long before you do yourself!","Mary McEvoy paints this picture in her most recent book: “They were old and sat together at the bar, staring straight ahead. They drank slowly, not talking. Unhappy?  Maybe. Or maybe all those years together had birthed a kind of harmony. They accepted each other so perfectly that sitting side by side was enough.”","Prayer can be like that too.  In our early days we pray set prayers and in Mass we pray prayers others have composed for us.  But there’s no substitute for the prayer of presence, just sitting with Jesus.  We’ve known him for so long.  There’s no need to say much.  We’re aware of his presence and we’re happy about it, aren’t we?  Remember when St. John Vianney asked an old man, who was constantly praying in the church, how he could pray so much, the old man said, “It’s easy.  I just look at him and he looks at me. ” Of course it won’t be easy and we won’t be able to look at him if the relationship is broken in some way.  Like with any close friend.","Only when the presence is broken in some way do we realise how precious it is!","",""]},{"title":"Revelations","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters CP","Sunday February 28th. 2016","","","These are the humble confessions of a mass – goer: “Recently, a young woman came to Mass pushing a large double pram. In it were three children, all very young. As the Mass proceeded, I peeked over and examined the family, and was impressed. The three children were exceptionally well behaved. They sat there quietly and seemed to understand the sacredness of the occasion. Then, I noticed that one little girl wasn’t wearing shoes. It was the middle of October! My eyebrows went up, and I began to judge the woman. Bad mother; no shoes on the kids.\nAs I continued to pay more attention to this mother’s negligence than to the Mass, I remembered being in a shop once with my child, Tommy. He was about ten months old and had a very bad cold. His nose was running. I didn’t have any tissues. A lady in the shop gave me the dirtiest look, and I felt like I could read her thoughts: How could I let the mucus drip down my child’s face like that?? Bad mother; not wiping that kid’s messy nose.\nIt’s so easy to judge. But when we are judging, we are forgetting how hard life is, sometimes, and how none of us can have it together every second of every day. Around communion time, I saw the mother putting pink tennis shoes on the little girl. I realized the child had wanted them off, and now this attentive mother was putting them back on. So I learned my lesson that week: Don’t judge.\nThe next week I saw the woman again. This time, the three little children were clad in bright pink bunny pajamas complete with feet. Instead of looking down on the whole group, I smiled and admitted to myself that this woman had courage. She didn’t care what the precious churchgoing folk thought about her and her kids; she just wanted to get to Mass. In my head, I became a champion for this lady, deciding that I really liked her. Even if kids had messy hair, not one of those children made a sound. She was, I now judged, a great mother. And then I saw her. The older lady in the seat in front of us! She was well-dressed, with her makeup carefully applied, and she would not stop staring at the lady with the kids. Staring and shaking her head and sneering in judgment. So, of course, I began to judge her! Had this lady forgotten how hard it is to raise kids, let alone three of them under the age of six? Had she even been a mother in the dark ages of her past?\nI started shaking my head too, because it was driving me crazy. She wouldn’t stop staring at, and judging, that young family. And I couldn’t stop staring at, and judging, her. And then it hit me: being judgmental is an awful cycle. For all I knew, someone in another pew could have been watching me watching her, the older woman, as she stared at the younger one. I had to soften my heart and see that neither of us was focusing on what mattered.\nI thank God for his revelations.

Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 21st February 2016","","Recently, I shared with you the words of that beautiful song:  “Stranger, standing at my door, / You’re the Christ I can’t ignore.” This song helps us see Jesus in many strange disguises. But Mary McAvoy, in her recent book, writes about a different kind of stranger: “Today I will do nothing. I will recognize my fatigue. I will sit and read, stretch and breathe. This is a new science for me, untried and frightening in its way. It must be done, however, I must meet myself, the stranger in my own house.”  There’s much truth in this too. We can be travelling so fast we have no time to catch up with ourselves. Maybe we don’t even want to. We suspect the ‘real me’ is not very nice. We prefer to live with the ‘dream me’.","In Louisville, Kentucky, there’s a plaque in a pedestrian mall commemorating a very significant moment in the life of Trappist monk, Thomas Merton. On 18th March 1958, he was at that place when he was struck by one of the great\n insights of his life. He looked at the people all around him in the mall and realized, “I am one with them. They are not ‘they’ but part of my own self. There are no strangers!” This insight had a radical impact on Merton. “It was like waking from a dream” he said. And these are among his last words on 10 December 1968: “In each one of us the Christian person is that which is fully open to all other persons because ultimately all other persons are Christ.” So we’re back to the ‘Stranger standing at my door.”","Merton’s insight in 1958 with its sense of solidarity and its confident expectation of finding God at work everywhere in the world was not normal in 1958. Not many Catholics in 1958 – or maybe even today – could truthfully say with Merton, “There are no strangers.” Thomas Merton was acutely aware of the human genius for self –deception. It glared at him from his own soul and dogged him all his days. He knew only too well how we can evade what is true and real. “Every one of us is shadowed by an illusory person: a false self” he wrote in New Seeds of Contemplation. And he knew this same tendency operates not just in individuals but in all human systems including institutionalised Christianity. The churches prided themselves on their difference from the world and failed to foster solidarity and a deep sense of unity in the whole human family. Because of his Louisville experience, Merton could say,","“It is a glorious destiny to be a member of the human race, though it is a race dedicated to many absurdities and one that makes many terrible mistakes: yet with all that, God gloried in becoming a member of the human race.”",""]},{"title":"Stella Reekie","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 14th February 2016","","Stella Reekie was a Scottish nurse who joined the Red Cross at the outbreak of World War Two in 1939, and served right through the war. In 1945 she was among the first British people to experience the horrors of the German concentration camps. That experience changed her life. She wanted to spend the rest of her life in the relief of suffering, in healing and reconciliation work. She stayed on in Germany after the war working with the refugees who had lost their homes and were searching for food and shelter. Later she worked in Bangladesh for 25 \nyears until she retired and returned to Glasgow. In her retirement she was invited by ‘Churches Together in Glasgow’ to serve as a Christian link for the many Muslim people living in and around Glasgow. Stella didn’t restrict herself to Muslims. Her international flat, as she called it, became a little United Nations offering hospitality to all comers. She died of cancer and at her funeral service in 1982 there was a large international gathering of many different faiths and none. After reading Psalm 139, with its words: “Such knowledge is too wonderful for me, too high to grasp, too great to understand,” a Sikh leader said, “Stella Reekie was too great for me, too high to grasp and too great to understand … She suffered for us up to her last breath, so that we … could get together, enjoy ourselves together, and learn to live in love, peace and harmony. To us, Stella was like water; she cleansed us, gave us life and assumed the shape of whoever she was with. To me she was a Sikh, to my Muslim friends a Muslim, to my Jewish friends, a Jew, and to Christians she was a Christian. I never understood what Christians meant when they said, ‘Jesus died for our sins’, but I know that Stella gave her life for us.”","It took a Sikh to sum up the essence of Christian life. Stella gave life to those she met. She recognized the sacred nature of every human encounter. She wasn’t trying to convert people. She just let people be. They sensed her good will and respect and felt at home with her. Remember Jesus’ home town people were enraged when he said the Jewish prophets reached out beyond the borders of Israel to Sidon and Syria and at times only the foreigners had faith enough to be healed!.","Could we have any better program for Lent than this: to treat everyone, strange though they may seem to us, with reverence and respect, with an open heart and an open mind?",""]},{"title":"A Little Wickedness!","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters CP","Sunday 7th February 2016","","","","","There’s a saying down Tipperary way about a fellow “having a great welcome for himself!” For himself! I’m sure it’s not confined to Tipperary! My father told us once that he saw a man “shaking hands with himself” all night at a function and we discovered afterwards that indeed it was true but the poor man was ‘a bag of nerves’ and the shaking was more in tension than in welcome! I also remember hearing long ago that a friend of Geoff Boycott, the great cricketer, said “Geoff fell in love with himself when he was young and he remained faithful ever after!” With friends like that who needs enemies? I must admit I’ve always been jealous of people who can dream up smart remarks like these. Why didn’t I think of that? In our community we love recalling how a certain Brother was driving a certain priest to the airport, and as they came close to the airport, the certain priest, who was a bit pompous, took to quoting Shakespeare very solemnly: “Brother, if you have tears, prepare to shed them now!” and Brother, quick as a flash, replied, “Why? Are you not going?” Wouldn’t it be great to be able to dream up responses like that on the spot and not a day later? I know some of you will feel I shouldn’t be enjoying remarks like these. Couldn’t they be hurtful? It’s true that humour can be hurtful but good humoured humour, which hurts no one but deflates the pompous seems to be applauded in scripture: “Be not just to excess, and be not over wise lest you be ruined. Be not wicked to excess but do not be a fool.” (Eccles. 7:16-17.) The inspired writer is asking religious people to keep their feet on the ground and seems to infer that a little wickedness is not all that bad!","The writings of St. Teresa of Avila are full of holy common sense, good humour and a little wickedness. In her commentary on the Song of Songs, she describes a lady full of self importance that’s all mixed up with religion and devotions, and Teresa says, “She and others like her were saints in their own opinion but when I got to know them, they frightened me more than all the sinners I had ever met!” She could laugh at herself too: “Blessed are you, Lord, who has made me so incompetent and unprofitable.” In her writings she calls herself stupid, always busy with really important things like her spinning wheel; she has no learning, suffers from ‘noises’ in her head, a bad memory and a rough and heavy writing style. And I’m sure you’ve heard her well known saying: “O Lord, it’s no wonder you have so few friends you treat them so badly!” And her other prayer, “From long faced saints and silly devotions, deliver us O Lord.” It’s true Teresa didn’t have much formal education but she had deep wisdom inspired by God’s Spirit: “You have not lost the anointing he gave you. You do not need anyone to teach you. The anointing he gave teaches you everything.” (1John 2:26). I meet people like that all the time and I’m sure you do too. They have wisdom learned from life and God’s spirit working in them.","“The important thing is not to think too much”, Teresa said, “but to love much, so do what best stirs you to love.”","","","","","","","","","",""]},{"title":"A Miracle of Forgiveness","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

Five died, five more were injured and one was left with severe brain damage. His mother, Terri Roberts, has written about all this, trying to make some kind of sense of what was senseless. When she first heard the awful news that her child had killed those other children she remembers falling to the floor in a foetal position and howling, just howling. It was all she could do.","How do you begin to understand that your child has been responsible for a tragedy like this? She and her husband combed through every detail, every memory, every clue trying to find what could have made him do what he did. But none could be found. Of course at times this mother raged with anger at her son: “How could he do that to innocent children, leaving his wife a widow and his children fatherless? Leaving them to face the shame and the horror?”","Terri could still be hiding away and howling on the floor if what happened at the funeral hadn’t happened. They dreaded the funeral. They braced themselves for the media barrage – cameras trained on them, everyone looking at them. But as they walked through the church yard, a group of these Amish people appeared, men in tall hats, women in white bonnets. They formed a line protecting them from the media and when the service was over they came forward in Terri’s words “their eyes, like mine, red with tears.” The first to approach were Chris and Rachel Millar, whose daughters, Lena and Mary Liz, had both died in their arms, and they said, “We are so sorry for your loss.” Again in Terri’s words, “I can’t describe what it feels like when people who have suffered so much at the hands of your son reach out and say something like that to you. To know that through their suffering they wanted to comfort us!” It is just extraordinary, isn’t it? Forgiveness like that is a miracle of grace. But Terri also called it a choice. Those good Amish parents, she said, were as grief stricken as I was, their hearts as broken as mine was. But they had chosen to forgive instead of hating, to reach out in compassion instead of in anger.”\nLater Terri came to know the Amish community and one day had the chance to visit Rosanna, the little girl who had pulled through but with brain damage. “While there,” she said, “I managed to hold myself together but when we left I started to bawl my eyes out, knowing my son was responsible for this.” There are no words for the awfulness of what happened to those children; neither are there words for the marvel of forgiveness shown by those Amish people. This is what Christian mercy and forgiveness looks like.

Many more were met with rejection and miles of razor wire.","But after a year of terrorist attacks, I can see why people think we’re naïve in welcoming large numbers of migrants especially when we have such a problem trying to provide for our own homeless and because asylum seekers are already spending so many years in Direct Provision Centres (often described as prisons!).

But above all such considerations, it’s the mood of our times that is most troubling. The defining feature of our age is fear and the rise of intolerance. And prejudice is a way of refusing to engage with “a maddeningly complex world.”","I feel he’s right about that. We can recognise it in our own hearts. It is such a complex world and it’s so hard to know which voices to listen to when bombarded with propaganda from all sides. But we mustn’t let fear or prejudice turn us into unfeeling robots concerned only for our own. We mustn’t let what happened in Germany on New Year’s Eve give us a reason to condemn all refugees.

I knew her in later life and she was always wearing a black straw hat and I was told by someone that it was always the same hat but she just put new artificial flowers on it every year so it looked like new! And I used be aware that she knew me when I first appeared, a frail scrawny little thing. Anyway, Nurse Harte called when my father was in charge and the first thing she said was, “That nappy needs changing!” And he, all helpless, said, “But there’s no one here!” And she said, “You’re here, aren’t you?” He never thought of that! Or if he did, he didn’t think that was a man’s job. Nurse Harte could be very cross with helpless men.

Dare to really care. Allow yourself to look beneath someone’s surface needs. Don’t be so sure you know the best way you can help. A very good question to ask is, “How may I help?

Today, like every Monday, as I left class, I went to have a cup of coffee on the patio of a café. The coffee didn’t taste different from last week, the waitress’s smile was no different and the regulars were sitting at the same tables. Like every Monday I took yesterday’s newspaper out of my bag almost mechanically and skimmed the headlines. But I don’t recognize the newspaper that I flip through every week. The logo is at half mast, and there is only one headline: “Sorrow and Anger.”","A picture of a man crying in front of a bouquet of flowers, candles and a French flag made the headlines. A man, tears, sorrow, anger, death, innocent people, injuries; I don’t want to read anymore. I put down my paper, swallow my coffee and pay. For the first time this year I left this place where I am in the habit of reading my newspaper in peace early.","So what should I do? Go home like the authorities advise us to do? No. I decided to walk to a place that is familiar and precious to my heart. After a five-minute walk, here I am. This place is my parish church, my second home, the Lord’s house. I go in. There are a lot of people. I sneak in silence to the altar dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary. No room there. The only remaining spot is a kneeler in front of the altar of St. Rita, the saint of lost causes and impossible things.","A passage from the Gospel according to Matthew comes to mind: “But I say to you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them who spitefully use you, and persecute you” (Matt. 5:44).      So I had an idea. I did not pray for the victims or for the bereaved or for the salvation of my beautiful homeland. Today I have prayed for you. I prayed to St. Rita that she help us to forgive. I asked her to help the French forgive you. I prayed for the families of the victims so that one day they can forgive you, forgive your unjustifiable and barbaric action. I asked the Lord, with the help of all my faith, to come help me, to come help us all to forgive. I asked St. Rita to bless you and to bring down the Grace of the Holy Spirit upon you.","I hope, dear terrorist, that these words will reach you so that you come to realize hatred and death are not the solution—-A young Catholic who is trying to forgive.”","","","",""]},{"title":"Stranger Standing at my Door","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

Ignatius Waters CP, Sunday 8th November 2015","This is a poem written to young girl in 1870 by Gerard Manly Hopkins. It was in our school book and it spoke to me even then, probably because, like Margaret, I hated to see the leaves falling:\nMargaret, are you grieving\nOver Goldengrove unleaving?\nLeaves, like the things of man, you\nWith your fresh thoughts care for, can you?\nAh, as the heart grows older\nIt will come to such sights colder\nBy and by, nor spare a sigh\nThough worlds of wanwood leafmeal lie;\nYet you will weep and know why.\nNow no matter, child, the name:\nSorrow’s springs are all the same.\nNor mouth had, no nor mind expressed\nWhat heart heard of, ghost guessed:\nIt is the blight man was born for,\nIt is Margaret you mourn for.\nThe poet is saying you seem to be mourning the falling leaves but really it is Margaret you mourn for! How can he say that to a little girl? Because there’s truth in it! And maybe he’s really saying it to himself? I was present when a father had to tell his children that their mother had died in a drowning tragedy and I will always remember little Claire (aged 6) asking this question: “Who’s going to take us to school in the morning now?” This is a child speaking, a child fearful and lost, and a child is more open and honest than the rest of us. A lot of our grieving can also be concern for ourselves. How am I going to cope? Has this old life any real meaning? Sorrow’s springs are all the same! Ask not for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for you. Everything is passing and every death and every loss and every separation reminds us of that – even leaves falling from a tree!","Death is horrible and nothing prepares us for the ferocity of grief at the death of a father or mother, husband or wife or any loved one and most especially the death of a child. But, if only we could channel the energy in this ferocious grief and depression into something positive. Of course there’s no avoiding the stages on the way to something better and if your bereavement was recent, you’re probably not yet ready for talk like this at all. Grief is a real sickness and it takes time to heal. But we need to work at transforming it into even greater love and caring for those still with us. In a similar way, sorrow and guilt for our sins can become a real sickness, overwhelming us so that we’re no good to God or man. That’s why St. Thomas Aquinas said “Sorrow even for the greatest sins should be transitory” meaning it should be going somewhere. It should be moving us on. Moving on from preoccupation with ourselves, our sins and our sorrows into people who have time, concern and energy for others!","So a very good way to remember our dead is by being fully alive ourselves, living well and loving well the people still with us."]},{"title":"Falling In Love With God","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 1st November 2015","","","Martha Beck, a Lecturer at Harvard, was pregnant with a Down syndrome baby and not coping very well. She had a supportive husband and many friends but one day it dawned on her that no matter how helpful and loving people tried to be, she was going to end up facing her fears alone. She sat down on the floor sitting back on her heels and as she said, “holding my enormous tummy” and tried to talk to God: “Listen, I’m sorry I’m so weak. But I can’t do this anymore.” Another contraction hit and she had to stop talking. When it passed, she felt so exhausted she almost fell over sideways. “I’m sorry” she gasped again, “but I can’t. It’s too much for me. Please, please.”","What she remembers most about that moment was a sense of letting go. For the first time she felt she prayed without trying to control the outcome. She was too tired to try to control anything. And she realized slowly that for years she had been living on illusions of what brought happiness – prestige, intellect and praise. At the moment that she stopped fighting for control of her little universe, she noticed something that had been there all along and she just hadn’t noticed. I’ll let Martha take up the story. “It was slightly to the left of me, maybe eighteen inches off the floor. It was a person – or rather a person’s feet. That was all I saw – a pair of bare feet, standing in the air, with the hem of a robe falling around the ankles. I didn’t even bother to look up at the person’s body or face. Some of the few people I told about this experience asked me why not. All I can say is when you are reunited with the love of your life, you don’t hold yourself at arm’s length. This being wasn’t unfamiliar to me at all. I wasn’t surprised or stunned or frightened. So I simply leaned forward letting my forehead rest against those suspended feet and began to cry like a child who had been found after being lost in a storm. What amazed me more than the physical presence in the room was the love that came with it. I felt as though I were caught in a glowing tidal wave of love, a love so strong that all the pain on earth couldn’t even begin to put a dent in it. I don’t know how long it lasted: maybe thirty seconds, maybe ten minutes. Not more than that. Whatever it was, my entire existence still hinges on that brief encounter. It is the center point for me, the single event that divides my life into before and after.","We celebrated the Feast of St. Paul of the Cross last week and he had a similar core experience that influenced his whole life. “In a moment of time” he said, he glimpsed the glory, the greatness and the beauty of the living God, and all he could do was gasp with wonder. He was breathless with awe and wonder and reverence and the tears came flowing in streams. How else can you respond to an overwhelming experience of goodness and beauty? It touches your whole being. It’s no longer an “idea” we have about God in our minds. It possesses us. All that came afterwards in Paul’s life: the gathering of companions, the preaching and teaching, the prayer and  penance, was designed to bring as many people as possible to a similar experience of the great, good and  beautiful God.","And bring as many as possible to also fall in love with the living God.","","","","","",""]},{"title":"Talk about it!","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters CP","Sunday 25th October 2015","","","","On Tuesday 5th October, on his morning show, Sean O’Rourke interviewed two women who had been greatly helped by a group called GROW. One woman, Josie, suffered from chronic pain, the other, Mary, had suffered from chronic stress and depression. Mary’s accent captured my attention because it was a Navan accent and she told her painful story so simply and honestly. A family dispute had been going on for 12 years which seriously affected her financially and every other way. She has 3 children. One son has ADHD problems; her daughter also had health problems. Mary was working every day but things were just getting worse and worse; she had no support at home; she had to keep saying to the children, “Sorry, Mammy has no money” Until things got so bad one day driving home from Dublin with the 3 children asleep in the back seat that she decided everyone would be better off if she ended it all. She knew a place where there was a bad bend on the road and decided to crash into the wall there but somehow, she can’t explain how or why, when she saw the BAD BEND sign her foot, almost of its own accord, rose from the pedal. But when she went home she cried her eyes out. And she at last asked for help and ended up in the psychiatric ward in Navan hospital.  With all the help she received there and from this organization called GROW, Mary is now a new woman working in her community and speaking in public, which she could never do before.  She was on the verge of ending her own life and her children’s lives and now she’s giving life to others and rejoicing in her children every day.  But after being in hospital for 14 weeks, one of her problems was the shame of appearing in public after all that time. Afraid of what people would be saying about her – that she was mad and all that! But the Grow group gave her ways of dealing with this. She was to go for a walk each day (or twice a day) and keep saying to herself over and over “People that mind, don’t matter and people that matter, don’t mind.” And they had other words of wisdom for other situations and at the weekly meeting she could report how she got on and had great support from people who had gone through similar ordeals.","If you were battling cancer, everyone would be supportive; if you were recovering from cancer, everyone would be rejoicing with you. So why is there still such shame and stigma when it comes to depression and stress which are like cancer of our poor minds?  But there is and that’s why people are so slow to talk about it, like Mary who almost left it too late.  But it was so refreshing and encouraging to hear her story and the marvelous work of GROW.

This is short extract. “I will never forget Manila – the noise, the pall of smoke hanging over the streets, people with hankies held to their faces. I promised myself I would never again complain about Dublin traffic or Dublin pollution!  And then we were brought to “Smokey Mountain”  “Great!” I thought, delighted to get out of the city!  I imagined a mountain with its summit in the clouds. How wrong I was! There were clouds alright but they were clouds of smoke hanging over the city dump that stretched for miles and miles. I’ll never forget the horrible sickening smells, acrid and putrid, attacking the back of your throat. You feel you’re going to get sick. There are flies everywhere. The sun is blotted out and the poor unfortunate people hardly distinguishable from the piles of rubbish except when they moved, hundreds of them searching with their sticks, scavenging among the rubbish for anything of value, plastic, tin cans, anything to recycle.  These people actually live in the dump, in their pitiful little houses and shops. I saw even a fish shop! I saw one small shack with a garden full of flowers. And they’re so cheerful, so ready to smile and say ‘Hello’. There’s a small church there too. The priest was Fr. Ben. He spoke to us about the experience of living there. He had a Doctorate in Theology, he said, but he learned more about God from these people than from all his studies!","Now that was in 1991. But in this month’s Intercom magazine, Sally McEllistrim, from World Missions Ireland, writes this about her recent experience: “We stood in the baking heat of Manila and watched children naked and crawling with lice and sores run about a cemetery where they live. We have seen some sights in our lives but none of us could really get our heads around the idea of people living in a cemetery.  The reality of finally seeing it was shocking. Almost 2000 people are born, live and die amongst the grey tombs.  They have nowhere else to go. They scratch out a living looking after the tombs and are particularly busy during November!  Two Columban Sisters began helping them and working with them in 2011.  Sr. Julie says, “We have done a lot of work with them; we have feeding programs, we taught them about hygiene and personal health, we have taught them about respect for others and themselves but it’s an uphill battle.”","“Missionary work is like shoveling light into a dark hole” according to a missionary priest in Korea.  And that work is needed in every time and place."]},{"title":"Blessed Columba Marmion","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.Ignatius Waters CP Sunday 11th October 2015","","Blessed Columba Marmion (Feast 3rd. October)\nWhen I was about eight years of age, my mother put me on the bus in Navan and gave instructions to the bus conductor to let me off at Ross Cross. I was on my way to visit my cousins, the Marmions. I remember I brought gifts of colouring books for them. Do you remember those colouring books? All you had to do was brush water over the pages and the colours appeared like magic.\nRoss Cross was only about four miles outside the town but it was the longest journey I’d ever gone on my own. So I would have been excited and nervous at the same time! The plan was that Thomas Marmion would meet me with horse and trap, but when I got off the bus at Ross, there was no Thomas, no horse and no trap and I never felt more alone and lost in my short life! Eventually he did arrive and the journey in the trap seemed endless but it was a great adventure over past Dunsany Castle to Derrypatrick. Mrs. Marmion was my mother’s sister but only much later in life did I learn that it was to this house that the great and saintly Benedictine Abbot, Dom Columba Marmion, sometimes came on visits. I attended the Diamond Jubilee of Sr. Marcellus Marmion and she remembered his visits there when she was a child. She was watching very closely the progress of his cause for canonisation but did not live to see him beatified by Pope John Paul 2 in Rome on 1st. September, 2000, the same day that John XX111 was beatified.\nDuring my student days I was well aware of Columba Marmion. We were reared on his writings! But only a few years ago did I discover that when he was a student in Clonliffe from 1874 to 1879, he visited a Passionist house and thought seriously about becoming a Passionist. That must have been Mount Argus where Fr.Charles was living and ministering at the time. I’m sure the young Joe Marmion (as he was then known) must have known about Fr.Charles and may even have met him. Later, after ordination, he was a curate in Dundrum for a year and a few years teaching in Clonliffe. Then he left the diocese and joined the Benedictines at Maredsous Abbey in Belgium.\nI wrote down these words of Dom Marmion when I was a student. He was explaining how there are priests and religious people who are very learned and who live very strictly but whose ministry is more or less unfruitful. You go to them, he said, in times of trouble, and you meet a brain, head knowledge but no heart, no compassion. And he concluded, “Only the heart touches hearts. We influence people in proportion to our love for them.”\nColumba Marmion was so wise spiritually but was easily deceived by imaginary bargains. He loved telling the story of how, as young priest in Dublin, he bought a horse and trap for a community of Sisters and thought he’d got a great bargain. But the horse was old and decrepit and the trap fell to pieces in no time! Maybe it was fixed up and left to his family? Maybe that’s the trap I travelled in with Thomas Marmion when I was a child? Stranger things have happened!"]},{"title":"Kayla Mueller","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 5th October 2015","","","","There’s no doubt Kayla Mueller is a modern martyr. This young American woman died earlier this year while she was being held hostage by Islamic State militants. Kayla graduated in 2009, and began working with humanitarian groups in northern India, Israel and Palestine. In 2012, the war in Syria and the resulting refugee crisis led her to travel to the Syrian/Turkish border, where she worked with Support for Life and other organizations. On one occasion after a bombing she was able to reunite a man with a six year family member. At the time she told a reporter, “For as long as I live, I will not let this suffering be normal. I will not let this be something we accept.” At age 26 she had every right to think she would live long but she was kidnapped in Aleppo in August 2013 and spent 18 months in Isis captivity.","Since her death it’s often been said that Kayla did more in her 26 years than many people in a lifetime but it’s also true that she was able to grasp a deeper understanding of God than most people do in a lifetime. In a letter to her father in 2011, she wrote, “I find God in the suffering eyes of people. If this is how God is revealed to me, this is how I will forever seek God. Some people find God in church. Some people find God in love; I find God in suffering people. I’ve known for some time what my life’s work is, using my hands as tools to relieve suffering”. Kayla wrote these words when she was no more than 23 years of age. To see God’s face in the eyes of those who suffer unspeakable violence and desolation is a charism that is rare at any age.","She had every reason to be angry with Islamic fundamentalists but in letters home it’s herself she’s angry with for all the worry her work has caused her family. She still saw the darkness around her for what it was but managed to find grace in it: “I’ve been shown light in the darkness and have learned that even in prison one can be free. I am grateful. I have come to see there is good in every situation, sometimes we just have to look for it.”","Two Yazidi girls were held with Kayla for several months last year and they reported that she was “married by force” and sexually abused by Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Kayla’s faith and courage through all she suffered can speak to those tired of a Christianity that sees wealth and power as signs of God’s blessing or see religions as a divisive force in the world. I marvel at the deep spirituality of this young woman. We so often seek God for our own solace and comfort. She sought God in the eyes of suffering and marginalized people.","Kayla has much to teach us about God and the Passion of Jesus","","","","",""]},{"title":"Who the Greatest?","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 27th September 2015","","In the Gospels Jesus’ disciples were arguing and fighting among themselves about who was the greatest! And we are not very different though it may not be so obvious. In a lot of our arguing, we can be competing with others and comparing ourselves with others. When we condemn the stupid things other people do, we can be boosting ourselves and promoting ourselves. I’m far too intelligent and upright to do a dreadful thing like that!  We compare how men think about things and how women think about things. And who is more intelligent, sensible and capable. And it goes on even into old age. I remember an incident at home when my parents were old. My mother, down the country in Navan, had an appointment with the Optician. And my sister, Rosemarie, here in Dublin, noted the date of in her diary (she’s very good at that!) and on the day rang up at midday to see how mother got on. But, much to her surprise, my father answered the phone, a surprise because normally he wasn’t allowed to answer the phone! He wasn’t great at taking messages or even remembering there was a call! So my sister asks, “Is Mammy not home yet?” “Oh, she’s here alright,” says he, “Why?” “How did she get on with the Optician?” asks my sister. There’s a pause and he says, “Oh, my God, I forgot to ask her!” Then there’s an even longer pause and he says, “That’s why she let me answer the phone!” Now you may not understand this because it’s very subtle indeed. You see, mother came home from her appointment and was very annoyed with him for not remembering and being concerned about her, and she knew what that phone call would be about, (she just knew!) – So, she let him stew in his shame! But poor mother was even more ashamed when I heard the story and then everyone heard it because it is a good story, isn’t it?","But it’s a story about all of us. There’s something of that in all of us. We argue about things that are not the real issue at all. And we fight more with those closest to us. We focus on the one time someone forgets to be loving and caring and concerned and forget the hundreds of times that they were!","A lady called Carolyn Heilbrun, a former professor at Columbia University, has a theory about this. She thinks we can catch ourselves on at last in old age and in long marriages. “Long marriages” she thinks, “occasionally endow their inhabitants with a rare kind of equilibrium otherwise almost unknown in human relations.”  She feels the value of the present moment has at last overshadowed the long history of resentments, betrayals and boredom.” Many husbands,” she says, “and many men are boring, certainly more boring than women, though no woman would ever dream of telling them so. I, like many women, was for long capable, at some act of thoughtlessness or forgetfulness on my husband’s part, of allowing that one sin of omission to serve as a mental magnet, attracting to it many other occasions when one’s temper was tried almost beyond endurance. But in my later years, this rush of memory and anger receded, indeed quite dissipated itself. Anger in my latter years was mostly about the present moment and did not reach beyond it, into either the past or the future.”","","This is something worth discussing – but not while driving!  And not without Triangle, Torch and especially Extinguisher!","","","",""]},{"title":"Stop persecuting my Son","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 20th September 2015","","","Frank Duff was the good and saintly man who founded the Legion of Mary way back in 1921. Once at a meeting of legionaries he spoke a lot about his own mother and many times his eyes filled with tears as he spoke. One memory was of a Franciscan priest, who was a great legionary, calling to his home and Frank’s mother opening the door with these words: “Why are you persecuting my son?” His mother was obviously ever ready to protect her son, probably thinking he was killing himself with all this Legion work added to his work as a civil servant!  He also recalled a time he was recovering from illness in his sister’s house in Navan. One day the doctor told him the worst was over, he was not going to die and could return to his normal work. He said he was stricken with sadness as he wanted to die so that he could soon be with his mother again! He admitted that, of course, he would still have Our Blessed Lady but his sorrow was that he would not yet see his mother.” These memories come from Noel Lynch, a former Legion envoy to South America.","At first I found this story extraordinary and disturbing. I certainly wouldn’t want an over protective mother like that! But then I remembered a similar incident in Jesus’ life. You remember his family was very worried about him, how hard he was working, having, at times, no time even to eat.  They thought he was ‘out of his mind’ and decided to take him in hand. And obviously they managed to enlist Mary in the delegation that went to speak to him. (This is very clear in Mark’s gospel) She too could have said, “Why are you persecuting my son?” or maybe, “My son, why are you allowing yourself to be persecuted?” It’s so very human and we understand it. And there’s no contradiction between this human anguish and Mary’s great faith. She had more faith than all Jesus’ followers: “Blessed is she who believed that the promise made her by the Lord would be fulfilled!” But that didn’t take away the pain, the darkness and the questions on the way to that promise being fulfilled. Being close to Jesus does not mean heaven on earth for anyone. Recently a mother, also full of faith, told me she felt like climbing up to the top of the Mourne mountains and howling to the heavens, begging God to heal her daughter dying of cancer at age 37. Having faith can in fact make it all the more heartbreaking.  And why? Because you believe in a God of love, mercy and compassion and you just can’t see how all these horrible things fit with that.","I cry aloud to God, cry aloud to God that he may hear me. In the day of my distress I sought the Lord, My hands were raised without ceasing; /My soul refused to be consoled./ I remembered my God and I groaned./I pondered and my spirit fainted./You withheld sleep from my eyes/ I was troubled, I could not speak,/ I pondered and my spirit questioned.     (Psalm 77)","","","",""]},{"title":"Fresh Heart and Courage","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

But imagine how strange it must be for someone learning English. You lost your heart? Hope you find it! And fresh heart might mean a transplant! But this need for a fresh heart or a new heart is mentioned a lot in the scriptures as is the need for encouragement – probably because it’s needed a lot!","But how on earth do you encourage those unfortunate migrants who risk everything in the hope of some kind of normal life for themselves and their children? Words are not enough. Millions of words are poured out in the media every day, words against them, words for them and I suppose the encouraging words do help. Jesus, you remember, used extremely strong and harsh language when he wanted to shock the Religious Authorities of his time into seeing what they were doing to people. But we see and hear so many awful things every day that we’re almost shock proof by now. The people abandoned and left to die in a locked airless truck near Vienna touched a new depth of horror. And then that frail little lad, three years old, thrown up like a rag doll among the rubbish on a tourist beach in Turkey! Like so many other things, we think “I can never ever forget that” but then it fades into the past like everything else. Let’s just hope and pray that what happened to that one small child, Aylan Kurdi, lying face down in his red T-shirt, blue shorts and infant’s shoes will spur those who can do something to do something. It’s so encouraging to hear that more than 6000 Irish people have already offered a bed to refugees in a program called Uplift. (uplift.ie)","God knows those migrants, desperate though they were, needed courage to leave behind all they knew and trust themselves to the humanity of civilised nations only to be abused and abandoned by criminals and traffickers and confronted by miles of razor wire in some places.","I know it’s hard for us to imagine what that must be like; it’s hard for us to put ourselves in their shoes – leaving one hell and finding themselves in another! Feeling they’ve made a terrible mistake and betrayed their children over again.","Meanwhile, all of us owe our very existence to the goodness and courage of others. G.K. Chesterton reminds us we all owe our existence to the courage of our mothers who endured nine months of pregnancy and the agony/ecstasy of giving birth.","Courage is parents enduring sleepless nights while raising their children.","Courage is teachers patiently trying to teach bored students, in some places dealing with intimidation and aggression.","Courage is doctors and nurses everywhere but especially in countries where hospitals are poor and ill equipped.","Courage is coping and caring for family members who are sick or depressed.","Children and young people, we know, need encouragement and praise more than anything else. Encouragement and kindness achieve far more than the cold bitter winds of criticism and condemnation. Why did people at home and in the Church for so long think they could help us best and love us best by telling us what was wrong with us? Why did they think they could get us to do good things and the right things by threatening us with the bogeyman or hell fire!

Silver in their hair, gold in their teeth, precious stones in their kidneys, lead in their feet and gas in their stomachs.” But we Seniors don’t think that’s very funny – do we? But here’s something serious: Seniors (and not just Seniors!) can have real gold and silver if they’ve gathered knowledge and wisdom from the experiences of their years. Now there’s real wisdom in what I’m going to pass on to you now. I don’t know who did the research but it says a lot in a simple way.\nIf you could fit the entire population of the world into a village of 100 people, maintaining the proportions of all the people living on earth, that village would consist of 57 Asians, 21 Europeans, 14 Americans (North, Central and South) and 8 Africans.\nThere would be 52 women, 48 men, 30 Caucasians and 70 Non-Caucasians, 30 Christians and 70 Non Christians, Heterosexuals and 11 Homosexuals.\n6 people would possess 59% of the world’s wealth and they would all come from the United States. 80 would live in poverty.70 would be illiterate, 50 would suffer from hunger and malnutrition. 1 would be dying, 1 would be being born, 1 would own a computer and 1 (yes, only one) would have a university degree.\nIf we looked at the world in this way, the need for acceptance and understanding would be obvious.\nSo, if you have never experienced the horror of war, the solitude of prison, the pain of torture, were not close to death from starvation, then you are better off than 500 million people.\nIf you wake up this morning in good health, you are more blessed than a million people who won’t live through this coming week.\nIf you can go to your place of worship without fear that someone will assault or kill you, then you are more blessed than 3 billion people. 3 billion!\nIf you have a full fridge, clothes on your back, a roof over your head and a place to sleep, you are wealthier than 75% of the world’s population.\nIf you currently have money in the bank, in your wallet and a few coins in your purse, you are one of the privileged few amongst the 100 people in our imagined world village.\nIf your parents are still alive and still married, you’re a rare individual.\nIf you can read this just now, you’re blessed. It means you’re not one of the 2 billion people who can’t read.\nThis is a lot to take in, I know, but it helps us see we have a lot to be grateful for. We just need the wisdom to see it!"]},{"title":"The stuff of holiness","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters CP","Sunday 28th June 2015","In our communities now most of us are ‘getting on’, as we say, and there’s hardly one that isn’t suffering from something or other. And we have different personalities and different opinions about everything and we find one another strange at times and of course we always think it’s the other one that’s strange – and not me! And come to think of it, this is not just a problem of ageing! My early years of priesthood were spent teaching in our Juniorate in the north. We were all young on the staff and one man who brightened our days then was Fr. Gabriel O’Prey. But he never liked to hear us criticise others and a few times when we must have been coming close to it, he jumped up on the great marble mantelpiece, (shows how young we were!) started scratching himself like a monkey and roaring, “Well, thanks be to God, we’re normal!” This became a famous saying among us, often repeated like a responsorial psalm: “Thanks be to God we’re normal, Alleluia! Alleluia!” A constant reminder that, of course, none of us can claim to be without fault, without sin, or normal, whatever that is!","I love this letter to God by a child not yet 11 years of age: “Dear God, why didn’t you tell Eve not to trust the snake? Then she wouldn’t have eaten that stupid old apple. Did you secretly want her to eat it? Love, Tristan.” What wisdom in such a young child! Because it does seem God’s plan always was to send Jesus to try to convince us we are loved despite being so small and weak, foolish and sinful. That great English lady, the mystic Julian of Norwich, summed it up like this: “First the fall and then the recovery from the fall and both are the mercy of God.” It is in falling down that we learn almost everything that matters spiritually. We talk about losing it, don’t we? Many of Jesus’ parables are about ‘losing it’. And there’s such joy and celebration when the lost one is found! Just as you almost have to lose hearing or sight or mobility to wake up the miracle they are. You almost have to come close to losing faith or hope to wake up to the gift they are. “I once was lost but now I’m found; was blind but now I see.”","But if this is how it is, what’s the use in trying to be good? This, you notice, was the question of the older brother in Jesus’ story of the Prodigal Son. He fancied himself as being the good son. We, as novices and students were killing ourselves trying to be good and perfect because we thought that’s what holiness was. And I thought I’d be holy, maybe not in a year or two but certainly by the time I was ordained! How daft and foolish that was! I heard Tom Murphy, the playwright, say something similar in a radio interview; how, as a young man, he had to rid himself of the idealistic image he had of himself, an image that was crucifying him. We were like that, too, and the trouble was that when we did fail and fall we were shocked and horrified, annoyed and disappointed with ourselves! And it had more to do with ourselves than with God. More like the self image being shattered! It took me quite a while to see that to be disillusioned with ourselves was the best thing ever happened to us. Even though it didn’t feel good, it was good! It was good to be rid of the false and foolish notions we had about ourselves! And when you hear the true stories of the saints you see they became saints in the human battle with sin and sufferings of all kinds.","","That’s the real stuff of holiness!"]},{"title":"Sacred Heart of Jesus","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters CP","Sunday 21st June 2015","(Written on June 12, 2015)\nThis morning I had to go to St. James Hospital for an x- ray on my swollen ankle. I’m afraid I’m not like my friend, Fr. Julian in Botswana, who thanked God for his muscular dystrophy and called it ‘a special grace that made him change his pace’. I don’t like my slow pace just now nor do I like having to sit waiting so long. But I admired greatly the staff in the x-ray department who got through 100 x-rays so efficiently and then started at no.1 again!\nI hadn’t brought a book so I studied all the people waiting and the posters on the wall. One poster said, “If you think you might be pregnant, please tell the Radiographer”. It was accompanied by a cartoon of a baby in the womb saying, “Please Mum, tell them I’m here!” This led me to recall that I was born on this Feast of the Sacred Heart which occurs on a different date each year. My mother told me the bells were ringing for evening devotions not long before I was born. And this in turn led me to think how my own heart has been beating all the years ever since, day and night without stop. Which is just extraordinary, isn’t it? And I never stop to marvel at it just because it seems so ordinary. But it’s far from ordinary. What car would run as smoothly as that for a hundred years or more? Not that I’m that yet!\nAnd that led me to think how people used sometimes mistakenly call us the Sacred Heart Fathers because of the heart badge we wear. And sometimes they call us the passionate priests or brothers! But these are happy mistakes. We should be happy to be called passionate; passionate about our faith and hope, and our ministry of mercy and compassion. We call our heart badge a sign. It can be a sign of the love and compassion of God for all people. Or it can be a sign of the heart of Jesus. St. Margaret Mary died in 1690 and St. Paul of the Cross, our Founder, was born in 1694 and devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus was spreading everywhere in the years Paul was growing up. Professor Owen Chadwick of Cambridge University said: “No evidence shows a direct link between the Passionists’ heart upon the robe and the development of the cult of the Sacred Heart during those years but it is hard to think that no connection existed.”\nBut above all for Paul, this sign represents our own hearts, a sign that we carve the name of Jesus on our hearts; that we remember in our hearts that we are loved by God; that we find God in the depths of our own hearts and help others to do the same. St. Vincent Strambi said that, above all else, God raised up Paul of the Cross to teach people how to find God in their hearts. And finally this sign we wear is a sign that people, all people, can expect to be welcomed with compassion and with heart when they come to us. It’s a mighty call and a mighty ideal!","May God inspire many more to join us in this ministry of heart and hope!","",""]},{"title":"A hug a day","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

Ignatius Waters CP","Sunday 24th May 2015","In the early days of the Charismatic Renewal (seems so long ago now!) I was very sceptical about the whole thing. Well, maybe not the whole thing, but aspects of it like praying in unintelligible tongues, and praying intimate prayers publicly! I felt people were talking to the gathering more than to God! And of course I didn’t want to be taken in by the whole thing! At the same time, I could see it was there in the scriptures and there was much that was attractive and genuine about it. But religious people think they know about God and religion and tend to be suspicious about new fangled things. I certainly was too good at vetting everything! So people suggested I should maybe go to a Conference for Priests and Religious at the R.D.S. – maybe they would be more normal!\nSo I did, but they were worse! I felt out of it. I was drowning in an ocean of sound as they prayed and sang with wild abandon as I saw it. And I was complaining, “If this is a genuine way of praying, why didn’t we hear about it before now?” I even saw a young priest healed of a terrible shake that he couldn’t control but I was still sceptical. Attracted and repelled at the same time!\nThen they announced there would be prayer for healing in small groups. I joined a group that was being led by an old, half blind Jesuit. I was impressed by the humility and honesty of the priests as they mentioned the areas of their lives that needed help and healing. Then we all prayed over them and the old Jesuit anointed them.\nWhen it came to my turn, I stuttered something about being full of doubts and questions about this whole way of praying, I was afraid of being deluded by it all and deluding others. The old priest said that was an honest prayer and they all started praying over me and he started anointing and, being half blind, the oil went everywhere and ruined my good new jacket! And my one though was, “Lord, deliver me from this mad carry on!”\nBut afterwards I happily joked about being “Well oiled!” because all my questions and doubts were answered in a way I just couldn’t explain. Anyway I wasn’t interested in explaining! I just didn’t care about them any more because I was filled with a joy and freedom I rarely experienced before or since. And, when I returned to base, I wanted to tell everyone! I was offering to speak and be a witness like the gospel said we should whereas normally I waited till I was asked! I wanted others to experience the same deep joy and peace that freed me from my anxieties, fears and doubts. Of course I needed to be oiled again many times since! And we all do. We need our hearts educated – not just our minds. And we need it all the time! We need spiritual and emotional intelligence as much and even more than the I.Q. type! And I came to see this wisdom was already there in the old prayers too. Didn’t we always pray that our hearts be filled and instructed by the Holy Spirit?","“Come Holy Spirit, fill the hearts of your faithful and enkindle in them the fire of your love.”"]},{"title":"Do you know what I think?","paragraphs":["","A Thought on Sunday\n  from the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, CP","Sunday 17th May 2015","","Do you know what I think?”  This has been the question encouraging people to seek information before they vote in the coming referendum.  As if information was all that was needed before you could make a responsible and considered decision. The church response, “Marriage is important – reflect before you change it” is not much better. It sounds like “You are going to change it anyway but reflect on what you are doing! And we know if we decide against redefining marriage on May 22nd, you’ll bring it back again and again till we get it right!” But do you know what I think? I think the whole thing has little to do with thinking and much more to do with feeling – deep, raw, heartfelt feelings!  There have been complaints about how little debate there’s been on such an important issue. But maybe it’s just as well.  A recent Prime Time debate quickly descended into passionate confrontational ‘argy bargy’ – each side talking and talking well but neither side listening! It was ‘We’re right, you’re wrong, we win, you lose, yes, no!’ At the same time, I couldn’t but love and admire both sides for their readiness to put themselves out there in the public forum to argue passionately for their deeply held positions. It was streets ahead of “Marriage is important – reflect before you change it!” You could clearly see how mightily important the issues were for these people. But of course the debate was going nowhere fast! And I was thinking, “If only, if only these good people could come together and bring all their energy, passion and experience to finding a way of achieving what both sides want. This is not as crazy as it may sound.","After centuries of condemnation, abuse and discrimination, gay people want the recognition, respect, equality and protection that every other citizen enjoys. And all right minded people want that for them too. The trouble is those who decided on this referendum seem to think redefining marriage as understood all down the centuries will bring this about – or at least begin the process. If only the wounds of the past could be healed as easily as that! Many equally passionately believe the institution of marriage must not be redefined; that this is not the way to go about achieving the respect and equality gay people rightly deserve. How can the wounds of the past be healed by causing further wounds and divisions? How can past wounds be healed by removing mention of mothers and fathers from a whole raft of previous legislation, as is proposed?","The two sides in this contest are not to blame. Those who thought complex issues like these could be decided by the blunt instrument of a referendum are to blame. And demanding an answer “yes” or “no” – “Yes” that sounds so positive! “No” that sounds so negative! Do you know what I think? I think neither side should win or lose. This is not a football match! The money wasted on this referendum should be used to fund some kind of “Human Relations Commission” (similar to the Labour Relations Commission) that could calmly, patiently consider the best ways of achieving what both sides want rather than having one side beating the other! This may sound whimsical and foolish at this stage but it’s the only way I can find right now to express my frustration with what’s being asked of us! And the mad rush to get this passed before we fully notice the consequences!","Mary Redmond died on Easter Monday aged 64. She was one of Ireland’s top employment lawyers. She was a member of the Labour Relations Commission for two consecutive terms. Her struggle with cancer since 2009 changed her in many ways including even as a lawyer. “I have changed as a lawyer,” she said, “ now preferring mediation to confrontation, seeking results both sides can live with rather than the lawyer’s traditional ‘Win: Lose’, favouring only one party.” This has even greater application to the issues at stake in the Marriage Referendum. The Prime Time debate chaired by Claire Byrne this week was much better and the signs were there that, given time, a coming together is indeed possible.","So let’s pray that the great God of us all, the God who has no favourites, will bring good even from this ill conceived Referendum.","","","","",""]},{"title":"Seeds are a curse","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

It’s all to do with dentures!","When I acquired mine, I got it into my head that no one ever had such an experience before! That’s until people in the church started telling me their stories! And they were extremely understanding and reassuring, telling me the denture needed time “to get bedded in”. They were so helpful I thought at times they were going to show me theirs! So I just want to thank all of you for your help at that difficult time.  Really there should be a support group for ‘dentured’ people in every parish. And perhaps even a “Day for Dentures” every year? There’s one for everything else! When I purchased my first Fixodent, I was toothless on top and couldn’t say the word Fixodent properly. When I confided to my support group that I couldn’t say ‘F’ clearly, they said, “Just as well!” Which shows you people with dentures are still quick witted and good humoured despite everything! But what about those awful seeds in the bread – inside and outside? No matter what it says on the Fixodent box, they manage to squeeze under the denture in droves leaving you seedy and irritable.","But really I shouldn’t complain.  Poor George Washington suffered far more than I did. By age 57 he had lost all his teeth but one and as a result his gums had softened.  He was given a denture made of human teeth but it fitted so poorly and hurt so badly he mostly kept his mouth shut. Anyway he had to – just to keep them in!

They get new teeth a few times during their lives but by about age 65 they run out of teeth and starve. So I shouldn’t complain about that either. Did you see that ad about the dogs with the dentures? That’s how I felt when I first saw myself with the perfect new teeth. I never had perfect teeth even when I was young. I had two crooked front teeth that people thought were cute but I didn’t. Now I’d welcome them back!","But isn’t it so ridiculous to take ourselves or our teeth or anything too seriously.

The first vocation is obviously the call into life itself. The mystery that we came to be at all, called into life, in a particular family, with particular values, in a particular place, at a particular time in history. And it’s good to reflect on our own story. It’s not a sign of old age but a desire to see and understand how God has been leading us and educating us through all that has happened in our lives. And all means all – the good and the bad, the successes, the failures, the influence of parents, teachers and friends. Life shapes us and carries us. I hope this little poem by John O’Donohue finds some echo in your own story and experience as it does in mine: “I love to live my life/ Like the river flows/Carried by the surprise/ Of its own unfolding.”\nWhen I was a child in Primary school and not yet eight years of age, (I know that because we transferred to the De La Salle school at eight) a Passionist priest came into the classroom dressed in the habit with the heart badge, the mantle, the sandals, the whole works! He was Fr. Fergus Clark, a native of Navan, my home town. The teacher asked me (why I wonder?) would I like to be a priest like Fr. Fergus. I was afraid of this apparition so I was very definite in my answer: “Oh no!” I said, “I want to be an ordinary priest like Fr. Herbert!” Fr. Herbert was the local curate. The story is too long for one page but I discovered much later that Fr. Herbert was anything but an ordinary priest and that the Passionists, despite their strange dress, were very good and ordinary men! Men of mercy and compassion! But isn’t it just extraordinary that my whole life’s journey grew from that early and ordinary human encounter? It’s as mysterious as being born!\nDuring our years of training and studies, we were separated from home and family. We were told we were leaving that world and entering another called ‘a state of perfection’. And, young though I was, this notion filled me with an uneasiness I couldn’t then put into words. It no doubt came from some deep ‘home’ wisdom but I certainly didn’t call it wisdom then. I just thought I wasn’t strong enough for this, detached enough or spiritual enough. On the rare occasions I gave voice to my fear, I described it as “a fear of losing touch with the man on the bike.” That man on the bike was my father and symbolised for me ordinary human life in family and work and all that was good and genuine in normal life. I didn’t want to be different from the rest of humanity and certainly not from ‘the man on the bike’ going home after a hard day’s work. How happy I was in later life to find Thomas Merton, the great spiritual writer and mystic of the last century, saying, “The illusion of a separate holy existence is a dream. Not that I question the reality of my vocation, or of my monastic life: but the conception of ‘separation from the world’ that we have in the monastery too easily presents itself as a complete illusion: the illusion that by making vows we become a different species of being, pseudo angels or spiritual men.”\nAnd he concludes by saying, “Thank God, thank God, that I am a man like other men, that I am only a man among others – it is a glorious destiny to be a member of the human race.”","All vocations must build on this foundation!"]},{"title":"IF Only One Kiss","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

But today, five -year – old Louise Kehoe “is in school, is happy and loving life.” Jennifer is part of the One Day More campaign group who say the current debate around fatal foetal abnormalities has “exclusively focused on abortion” at the expense of other care options. The group met with TDs to outline other care options including Perinatal Hospice Care which provides a variety of services for babies with life limiting conditions and their families. Jennifer had been told people in her situation go to England and have an abortion. But she said, “If my baby would get only one kiss in her life, I wanted to be there to give it to her.”","And God says the same to us in this text from Isaiah: “The Lord says Zion was saying, ‘the Lord has abandoned me, the Lord has forgotten me.’ Does a woman forget her baby at the breast, or fail to cherish the child of her womb? Yet even if these forget I will never forget you.” Can we believe this? Can we believe that even though we’re weak and flawed that God’s love for us will at least match Jennifer’s for her frail little baby?","Is this the God we believe in or is God for us the God whose love has to be earned by strict observance of all the laws. Is that why we’re so upset when we fail? We think it’s because we’ve offended God or hurt others. But it may be just because our self image is shattered. We’ve let ourselves down. Our efforts at being good may be a cult of self perfection or a matter of keeping the books balanced with a demanding God so he’ll have nothing on us! But God is certainly not impressed by a business relationship. And maybe the reason we’ve never experienced God’s love and compassion is because we never admitted we needed it. We never allowed it to happen for us. We didn’t want to need it! We are nervously trying to keep on the right side of God so we won’t need his forgiveness or compassion.

Especially for those of us who want to be a success even in the spiritual domain. She says, “Resign yourself to stumbling at every step, even falling. Love your powerlessness. What a grace when in the morning I feel no courage, no strength to practice virtue.” Isn’t it so hard for us to see that as a grace? After all our efforts we want to see some progress, some results, don’t we? But Therese says, “Those who live in the spirit of the Gospel are not anxiously looking to see the results. They are not counting on success or concerned about how much progress has been made.

With St. John, we can “know and believe in the love God has for us.” And yet we can be slow to take the next step and believe that God’s love is not for this life only.

We can believe pain; we can believe sorrow; why can’t we believe joy? We can believe the Passion; why can’t we believe the Resurrection? It was said of first disciples: “Their joy was so great that they still could not believe it!” Luke 24:41. They could not believe their joy! Where’s the catch? There must be a catch! In Ireland if it’s a lovely sunny morning, people are still doubtful: “I wouldn’t trust that day!” Is it same with joy?","Maybe we’re afraid to hope. “Don’t hope for much and you won’t be disappointed!” Are we preparing ourselves for disappointment in this too? I remember when things seemed to be improving in the North of Ireland I used feel my hopes rising and then later felt foolish for hoping when nothing happened. Remember St. Peter talks about the sure hope of Resurrection, a seeming contradiction, but a powerful way of describing the strength of his hope. When we struggle with faith, we’re in good company. The Apostles, who saw him after his resurrection, doubted. They saw him, they worshipped but some doubted. Thomas wasn’t the only one who doubted! Blessed John XX111, after the funeral of his sister was heard to whisper: “Heaven help us if it’s all an illusion” meaning all we believe about life and death. Mother Teresa, too, had long periods when she doubted if there even was a God, or if there was, whether that God had any interest in her. Teilhard de Chardin in his retreat notes wrote: “Everything would be easy if we could be sure that there is a Jesus at the other side. At the end of the day, the only real suffering is doubt.” It’s consoling that these good people struggled like we do. And we remember that Jesus was very gentle and understanding with Thomas and the others but he did conclude by saying: “Doubt no longer but believe.” And he did say, “Blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe.”","Sometimes the problem is we want to be able to explain how resurrection happens. We want to see and understand. “How can it be?” What is a spiritual body? How can all that we were remain in some way? Our bodies are reduced to dust or ashes with all we have ever learned or remembered. There are no back up disks. Or are there? St. Paul was asked similar questions: “Someone may ask, ‘How are dead people raised, and what sort of body do they have when they come back?” His answer is blunt and clear: “These are stupid questions!” “What is sown is perishable, but what is raised is imperishable, what is sown is weak, what is raised is powerful.” In another place, he says we are turning mystery into a problem to be solved. It is not like that. “We teach what scripture calls: the things that no eye has seen and no ear has heard, things beyond the mind of man, all that God has prepared for those who love him.” (1 Cor. 2:9.)","","Mother Teresa struggled with doubt and dark hours but she also said over and over again “Jesus will not deceive us. Jesus is incapable of deceiving us!” May this Easter be truly happy for us!",""]},{"title":"Why Did Jesus Die?","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters CP","Sunday March 29th 2015","Last Sunday before the 11 mass Kate and Margaret were wondering how they would explain to the children why Jesus had to die. This is a summary Of Richard Rohr’s answer to that question.","The common Christian reading of the Bible is that Jesus “died for our sins”–either to pay a debt to the devil (common in the first millennium) or to pay a debt to God the Father (proposed by Anselm of Canterbury, 1033-1109). The Franciscan philosopher and theologian, John Duns Scotus (1266-1308), did not agree with either of these understandings. Scotus was not guided by the Temple language of debt, atonement, or blood sacrifice (understandably used in the Gospels and by Paul). He was inspired by the high level cosmic hymns in the first chapters of Colossians and Ephesians and the first chapter of John’s Gospel.","After Anselm, Christians have paid a huge price for the strange idea that before God could love us, God needed and demanded Jesus to be a blood sacrifice to atone for our sin-drenched humanity. As if God could need payment to be able to love and accept “his” own children–a message that those with an angry, distant, absent, or abusive father were already programmed to believe!","For Scotus, the incarnation of God and the redemption of the world could never be a mere mop-up exercise in response to human sinfulness, but the proactive work of God from the very beginning. We were “chosen in Christ before the world was made,” as the hymn in Ephesians puts it (1:4). Our sin could not possibly be the motive for the divine incarnation, but only perfect love and divine self-revelation! For Scotus, God never merely reacts, but always supremely and freely acts, and always acts totally out of love. Jesus did not come to change the mind of God about humanity (it did not need changing)! Jesus came to change the mind of humanity about God. God in Jesus moved people beyond the counting, weighing, and punishing model to the utterly new world that Jesus offered, where God’s abundance has made any economy of merit, sacrifice, reparation, or atonement both unhelpful and unnecessary. Jesus undid “once and for all” (Hebrews 7:27; 9:12; 10:10) all notions of human and animal sacrifice and replaced them with his new economy of grace, which is the very heart of the gospel revolution. Jesus was meant to be a game changer for the human psyche and for religion itself. And still, to this day we begin with and continue to focus on sin, when the crucified one was pointing us toward a primal solidarity with the very suffering of God and all of creation. This changes everything!\nWe all need to know that God does not love us because we are good; God loves us because God is good. Nothing humans can do will ever decrease or increase God’s eternal eagerness to love. Told with more simple words, children will understand this."]},{"title":"Desiderata","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 15th March 2015","","“My name is Patrick. I am a sinner, a simple country man and the least of all believers. I am looked down upon by many. ”    These are the first words of what’s called “St. Patrick’s Confession” We’re used to the word ‘confession’ meaning confessing sins but it can also mean a confession of faith in which Patrick tells how God has guided him through everything that has happened in his life, the sins included!  Patrick really did see himself as a sinner, unlearned and ordinary. What was great about him was he trusted God with his life – just like Mary did: “Blessed is she who believed.” There’s a Greek word ‘proutes’ which I think describes Patrick perfectly. But it’s hard to explain what it means. It’s been described as a word with a caress in it! And it’s a word used all the time in the Gospels to describe Jesus. So it’s a word worth getting to know! It describes someone with a peaceful heart, someone gentle, someone who radiates calmness and deep joy. Jesus himself said this was what he would like us to learn from him: “Learn from me for I am gentle and humble of heart and you will find rest for your souls.” We know from last Sunday that Jesus could be angry too. This same Greek word describes what St. Paul calls the fruits of the Spirit in us: “What the Spirit brings is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, trustfulness, gentleness and self- control.” (Gal. 5:22) These are not nine different qualities but nine different expressions of the same thing, the same spirit in a person. And this is not just talk. I’ve met people like this. I’m sure you have too. You can see it in them before they open their mouths. It was said of St. Francis that he was always preaching the Gospel and only sometimes used words. Far better to preach by the way we live!","I feel Patrick was like that too. He was gentle and humble and ordinary, surprised to find himself in such an important role. You would feel at home with him. Yet people like this are also very strong because they depend completely on God – not on their own strength or cleverness. He was ashamed of what he called his poor education.  Again, listen to his own words: “I had it in mind to write but I hesitated until now; I was afraid of exposing myself to the talk of men who never had to change the language of their childhood days. In my case what I had to say had to be translated into a tongue foreign to me. I am unable to speak in the way my spirit and mind long to do, so that the sense of my words expresses what I feel.”","I’m sure he did his greatest work by the kind of person he was, by his gentleness and respect for people so that the words he spoke weren’t all that important. Like our Charles who never really mastered English! But it didn’t matter because the words he spoke came from his heart. His faith and his love were genuine and obvious for all to see! Or like our bearded Fr. Ralph but not just because of the beard! When people heard he was ill, so many said, “He’s so kind, always ready to help!”","So being like St. Patrick is being open and honest, admitting our weakness, not ashamed to let people know we believe and hope and that we pray and trust in God. Neighbours or those you work with, even those you live with, may sneer and say, “You’re not still into all that stuff!” There’s no need to write a defence. Just show by the way you live that ‘all that stuff’ really matters!","","",""]},{"title":"Jesus was Angry!","paragraphs":["","A Thought on Sunday\n  from the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, CP","Sunday 8th March 2015","","","If we grew up with a gospel of ‘gentle Jesus meek and mild’ it may come as a shock to us that Jesus wasn’t always meek and mild. Of course he was loving and compassionate towards the sinner, the outcast and the poor but he was also flaming angry with those who abused the innocent, the weak or the poor, and those who exploited others – especially those who exploited others in the name of religion!","","And there’s no contradiction between his love and his anger! The stronger, deeper and more passionate your love is for your people, your family, your children or grandchildren, the stronger, deeper and more passionate will be your anger if those same people are abused in any way. The anger is part of the love! Sometimes the problem is we’re not angry enough – maybe because we don’t love enough. Sometimes we have a duty to be outraged by the behaviour of others!","","Now I haven’t forgotten that anger is named among the seven deadly sins or tendencies and we grew up thinking anger was always wrong and sinful. But it’s not. Of course it needs to be managed. It needs to be baptised in some way. Anger is a powerful emotion that can explode like a volcano destroying everyone around it in molten lava and doing more harm than good!","","How do we manage it? How do we baptise it? How do we make it a power for good? First let me ask you the strengths, the powers for good that we grew up with – we called them virtues then. I think you will agree what was drummed into us at home, in church, in school, were the virtues of humility, patience, long suffering, obedience, and these are good virtues. They are virtues to keep the family and the community together. But there are other virtues that we never heard much about like truthfulness in naming a problem when there is a problem, like challenging an unjust situation in the family, in the parish or in the work place, taking a stand and taking the consequences – as Jesus does in the gospel today. That takes courage and planning. It’s easy enough to march and protest about water charges or any other popular cause! But scattering the cattle mart in the temple courts was far from popular with the farmers or the money changers or the temple authorities who of course benefited from the traffic and the trade! What enraged Jesus was that pilgrims from afar with different currencies were being fleeced at an exorbitant rate by the money changers. And the poor and humble pilgrims were practically blackmailed into buying animals for sacrifice inside the temple. Their own sheep were often vetted and rejected as not good enough. And all in the name of religion! But can you imagine the commotion as the cattle and sheep are driven out of the temple – the roaring and the cursing of the sellers and the buyers, people scrambling to get out of the way, the pigeons scattered, the money tables overturned. It was mayhem! And it couldn’t have happened on the spur of the moment. No, it had to be planned. We read in Mark’s gospel that Jesus arrived in Jerusalem the night before, went into the temple and looked around but it was late. No sense in having a protest with so few around! So he went out to Bethany with the twelve. No doubt they then planned their protest for the next day and it would have needed Jesus and the twelve and any more they could recruit to cause such an uproar. It was the beginning of people power. This whole episode is often called the ‘Cleansing of the Temple’.","","You can imagine the cleansing needed after cattle and sheep but more needed was the power hosing of corruption and injustice suffered by the poor in a place of prayer.","","","",""]},{"title":"If Only One Kiss","paragraphs":["","A Thought on Sunday\n  from the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, CP","Sunday 19th March 2015","In 2009 Jennifer Keogh was told her baby had little chance of surviving outside the womb. The tiny little girl had a hole in her heart, the cerebellum in her still developing brain was diminished and there were other complications. But today, five -year – old Louise Kehoe “is in school, is happy and loving life.” Jennifer is part of the One Day More campaign group who say the current debate around fatal foetal abnormalities has “exclusively focused on abortion” at the expense of other care options. The group met with TDs to outline other care options including Perinatal Hospice Care which provides a variety of services for babies with life limiting conditions and their families. Jennifer had been told people in her situation go to England and have an abortion. But she said, “If my baby would get only one kiss in her life, I wanted to be there to give it to her.”","And God says the same to us in this text from Isaiah: “The Lord says Zion was saying, ‘the Lord has abandoned me, the Lord has forgotten me.’ Does a woman forget her baby at the breast, or fail to cherish the child of her womb? Yet even if these forget I will never forget you.” Can we believe this? Can we believe that even though we’re weak and flawed that God’s love for us will at least match Jennifer’s for her frail little baby?","Is this the God we believe in or is God for us the God whose love has to be earned by strict observance of all the laws. Is that why we’re so upset when we fail? We think it’s because we’ve offended God or hurt others. But it may be just because our self image is shattered. We’ve let ourselves down. Our efforts at being good may be a cult of self perfection or a matter of keeping the books balanced with a demanding God so he’ll have nothing on us! But God is certainly not impressed by a business relationship. And maybe the reason we’ve never experienced God’s love and compassion is because we never admitted we needed it. We never allowed it to happen for us. We didn’t want to need it! We are nervously trying to keep on the right side of God so we won’t need his forgiveness or compassion. If this is true, it means we don’t trust God at all. Or Jesus.","St. Therese showed us a different way. She called it the ‘Little Way’. But that doesn’t mean it’s easy. It’s far from easy! Especially for those of us who want to be a success even in the spiritual domain. She says, “Resign yourself to stumbling at every step, even falling. Love your powerlessness. What a grace when in the morning I feel no courage, no strength to practice virtue.” Isn’t it so hard for us to see that as a grace? After all our efforts we want to see some progress, some results, don’t we? But Therese says, “Those who live in the spirit of the Gospel are not anxiously looking to see the results. They are not counting on success or concerned about how much progress has been made. They live by faith and confidence, giving themselves over completely to God’s mercy.”","","","",""]},{"title":"A Rainbow of Many Colours","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters CP","Sunday March 1st 2015","","Uncle Tom had a bad heart and when the family heard that he had inherited a billion euros they were afraid to tell him for fear he’d have a heart attack. So they asked the Parish Priest to please break the news to him. Fr. Murphy said ok and called on Tom one day. “Tell me, Tom,” he said, “If, by some miracle, you were left a billion euros, what would you do with it?” And Tom said, “Well Father, for a start, I’d give half of it to you and the parish!” And he didn’t get any further because Fr. Murphy had a heart attack! If a business man got a stroke we would probably say, “No wonder! Sure he killed himself building his kingdom!” But if Fr. Murphy gets a heart attack we might say, “Ah poor Fr. Murphy! He killed himself building God’s Kingdom!” And maybe he did. But equally he could be building his own kingdom without knowing it! We can deceive ourselves so easily. We can be so blind to our real motivation, to what is ruling us in all we do.\nThere was a very sad story in the news last week. Rachel Gow was 29. She was a beautiful girl; from the outside, it looked as if she had it made, a good degree and a good job and had moved in with her boyfriend in 2013. But she took her own life because she wasn’t where she felt she should be in her life. Apparently this girl kept talking about how her friends and siblings were somehow doing better than she was. Also, she expected to be married with children before she hit 30 but she wasn’t. So, after a row with the boyfriend over a text on his mobile, she killed herself. That is shocking, isn’t it? But we shouldn’t be too shocked because if we look deep in our own hearts we’ll find some of that same competing and comparing. And expectations as well! This kind of comparing was always there but it’s probably even worse nowadays when the lives of friends and acquaintances are paraded on ‘Facebook’ as if they have perfect relationships and perfect children, perfect home and perfect everything! Which, of course, is far from the truth but it all gets to you especially if you’re not feeling great yourself.\nThere is mention in the Book of Genesis of the ‘rainbow’ being a sign of an agreement between God and every living creature, between God and the earth. It’s a marvelous sign, isn’t it? Even today when we have so many signs we’re still always pleasantly surprised to see a rainbow, aren’t we? “Oh look at the rainbow!” “Where’s my camera?” I’m sure you heard the lovely story about the various colours in the rainbow competing with one another, each claiming to be the best and most needed. And how they had to learn they can’t be a rainbow at all until they all blend together and work together in glorious harmony. And so it is in every family, community and parish.\nWhat gets in the way is this deep seated need in all of us to shine in isolation, to be a great success and to impress others. We can be controlled by what we imagine are the expectations of others, our family’s expectations or the expectations we load on ourselves – like that poor girl, Rachel Gow.\nComing to see this and admit it can be a shock to our system but can also be a moment of grace and a moment of liberation.",""]},{"title":"Lent Already","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, February 22nd, 2015","It’s hard to believe, isn’t it? Lent already! But it is and I should be glad, you would think, since Lent means spring and lengthening of days! And there’s a touch of spring in the air and the evenings are definitely getting brighter. Our memories of Lent are probably dark and dreary – giving up things, fasting and abstinence! But what about seeing it as an opportunity to make a fresh start?","This is a true story. John (not his real name) was adopted as a tiny baby and always knew he was adopted. In his teens he had loads of pals but was easily led and was a great worry to his parents. Nothing they said ever got through to him – except this! One day he arrived home and announced that the girlfriend of one of the pals was pregnant but it wasn’t really a problem because she’d probably get rid of it! The mother who adopted him was shocked and said, “It? Get rid of it? Listen, John, did you ever think, if your mother thought like that, you wouldn’t be here at all!” And that was the first thing that seemed to get through to him. He went pale, his jaw dropped and it was his turn to be shocked!","I’m convinced all of us need to be similarly shocked into seeing things. Remember when Jesus shocked Peter by telling him he was a Satan? No doubt he didn’t like it at the time and probably didn’t believe it. He knew he wasn’t a saint but surely not a Satan either! But later in the courtyard, cursing and swearing that he didn’t know the man, he began to see how true it was. We can go through the whole of our lives thinking we’re nice and good and humble, wouldn’t hurt a fly and we don’t see or want to see how we can be a Satan at times, maybe a lot of the time, jealous, sneaky, mean and ambitious.","In a book called, “If you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him!” by Sheldon Kopp, there’s a powerful passage on the need to accept our dark side if we are to avoid its power over us. He gives this example: “A patient comes into therapy complaining that he does not get along with other people; somehow he always manages to say the wrong thing and hurt their feelings. He is really a nice fellow; just he has this uncontrollable neurotic problem. What this man does not want to know is that his “unconscious hostility” is not his problem, it’s his solution! He is really not the nice fellow he thinks he is; he’s a bastard who wants to hurt other people while still thinking of himself as a nice fellow. If the therapist can guide him into the pit of his own ugly soul, then there may be hope for him. Once this man can see how angry and vindictive he is, he can trace his own story and bring it to the light, instead of being doomed to relive it all the time without awareness.","Nothing about ourselves can be changed until it is  first accepted.”","That’s obvious, isn’t it, but hard to take! But isn’t it a thousand times better than never waking up to how selfish, proud, jealous, scheming we really are? Everyone else can see it but we don’t! Allow the Lord to shock you into life this Lent. It’s a moment of grace when it happens. It can bring a spring to your step and spring to your heart!","The best day in Peter’s life was the day he admitted to himself, “Yes, Lord, I am a Satan!”","And he went out and wept bitterly.","",""]},{"title":"Lead Kindly Light","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, February 15th, 2015","The readings at mass are often full of ideals and advice urging us to rise above worry and concerns about passing things, but instead of encouraging us they can have the opposite effect.  St Paul often tells us the whole thing is coming to an end, so don’t let anything worry you! Then, at other times, we see that he worried about many things himself!","So I thought I’d share with you a few things about John Henry Newman, another good and holy man but nearer to our own times. You know he made the momentous decision to leave the Church of England and was received into the Catholic Church by a Passionist, Blessed Dominic Barbari, in 1845. We like bragging about that precisely because Newman was such a holy and learned man beatified by Pope Benedict a few years ago in Birmingham.","But on the days when we feel anything but good or holy, it is encouraging to remember his struggles and the dark years he lived through after the big moment of his conversion. A synod of bishops in England discussed articles he had written and one of them reported him to Rome for heresy. He wasn’t told about this officially and only heard of it by chance. The Church authorities in London considered him unsound and difficult to deal with and they made sure he was kept at a safe distance. His friends didn’t realize how completely and utterly his position had been undermined and the awful cost to him.","His great patron and hero, St. Philip Neri, used say we should ‘despise being despised’ and Newman tried hard to live up to this, another great ideal. But he couldn’t free himself from anxiety and an acute sense of failure which led him to worry about his health and his future. All this brought him at one period to breaking point. He suffered greatly from insomnia and, even when he took a break, he was depressed with anxieties which, in his own words, were ‘sucking life’ out of him. He felt the weight of rejection which left him at times with a sense of uselessness. For instance, he wrote one day in his note book that he had wakened that morning with such a strong feeling that he was ‘encumbering the ground’ that he found it almost impossible to face the day. But this giant in the fields of Philosophy, Theology and Education battled through it all, was made a Cardinal by Pope Leo 13th and died at the ripe old age of 89 in 1890. Books have been written on how we need to keep working towards the huge ideals we have as Christians, as to a great light or beacon ahead of us. Not letting them overwhelm or crush us as can happen. St. Bernard said ‘the greatest enemy of the good is the perfect’ meaning the notion we have of how perfect we’re called to be can so discourage us that we give up on it all! What we need to do is accept the ideals and accept where we are but keep humbly working towards the ideals. They’re meant to be a kindly encouraging  light! You know, I’m sure, Newman’s prayer poem:","Lead, Kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom, Lead me Thou on! The night is dark, and I am far from home, Lead Thou me on! Keep Thou my feet; I do not ask to see the distant scene; one step is enough for me. I was not ever thus, nor prayed that you should lead me on; I loved to choose and see my path, but now lead Thou me on! I loved the garish day, and, spite of fears, pride ruled my will: remember not past years. So long your power has blest me, sure it still will lead me on, o’er moor and fen, o’er crag and torrent, till the night is gone; and with the morn those angel faces smile which I have loved long since, and lost awhile.","",""]},{"title":"Same Sex Marraige","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 8th February 2015","","A father recently told me his twenty five year old daughter came to him to tell him she was gay. He hugged her and said, “I know, I know, I’ve known since you were about five years of age!” He knew there was something different about her since that early age. And he described some details of that. Different, yes, but no different from millions more who, down the ages, have been abused and bullied for being themselves! In fact, parents have been first in welcoming and loving and reassuring their children that what was regarded as abnormal and a disorder by society or the church was, in fact, normal for them. We can only hang our heads in shame for the way gay people have been treated all down the centuries. We always fear what we don’t understand and, because of that, we condemn and demonise. So we should be very happy that at long last we have come to see how wrong headed we were and that society is ready to put right what was wrong. We still have a long way to go to the day when all the drama around “coming out” will be a thing of the past or that, if needed, it will be quietly celebrated. No life is easy but how much more difficult it must be when you have to hide and pretend and deny who you are.","I know this whole subject is very complex and painful and arouses a lot of emotion. No one can talk about it from on high. We as society and church have failed gay people and failed children in many ways. But society’s guilt at how gay people have been abused and ostracised in the past should not have us rushing into declaring that gay marriage is the same as heterosexual marriage. Or that there can be equality between gay marriage and heterosexual marriage. In pretending this is so, we are continuing to fail both gay people and especially children. I’m sure there’s not a man or woman in Ireland who would deny gay people equality in every way that’s possible. That’s probably why many people say they support gay marriage. If you believe the newspapers and the political parties, it’s already a done deal. There’s hardly any need to waste 20 million on a referendum! Writing almost two years ago, Francis Fitzgibbon said, “We are blessed in the gay community in Ireland. We have an enormous amount of power and influence in both the media and the establishment. Other minorities are envious of the power we have. In our quest for marriage equality and gay adoption, which will happen, we must learn to use this power in a positive way”. This seems to imply that its power and influence that will win the day rather than whether gay marriage is right or wrong.","But how can you claim a right to something that is impossible for you? How can a gay couple claim a right to marriage equality when the couple is incapable of having their own biological child and need donor sperm or surrogacy to have a child at all? As a general principle and putting the rights of the child first, as we keep saying we want to do, children are best reared by their own genetic parents. Of course, for many reasons, this is not always possible. But in gay marriage you set out to produce children that will not be reared by their biological parents. There is something very wrongheaded about this.","Keith Mills, a gay man, writing in the Sunday Independent last week, says he will be voting ‘no’ to same sex marriage. Marriage, he says, should remain the cornerstone of the family unit and the best way to do that is not to redefine it. Civil Partnerships, introduced five years ago, have proved very successful and are, to his mind, a better way of reflecting the reality of most same sex unions.","The Children and Family Relations Bill is trying to lessen the negative consequences and conflicts arising from the Gay Marriage proposal. I cannot see how anyone can say they will vote ‘yes’ until they give this Bill careful study, especially as regards the likely consequences for families and children."]},{"title":"Looking At Things Straight In The Face","paragraphs":["from the desk of Fr.Ignatius Waters CP","Sunday 1st.

In May 1942, Etty wrote in her diary: “O God, it is hard to take in or understand what those created in your image do to one another in these disjointed days. But I no longer shut myself away in my room. I try to look things straight in the face, even the worst crimes.” To look things straight in the face was her way of trying to deal with all that was happening around her. It helped her to passionately name how wrong it all was. It also helped her see it wasn’t just a battle being fought out there, but it was also being fought out in the depths of her own soul. To look inhumanity and falsehood straight in the face helped her see the same madness could also take hold of her own heart and soul. The very real temptation is to return hatred with hatred!\nWe may not realize it, but we carry depths of violence in our own hearts that we’re not fully aware of. The same is true of us as nations and religious traditions. History shows that. The actions of extreme Muslims can fill us with hatred for all Muslims. We can never imagine ourselves doing what those extremists did in Paris and elsewhere but, given different circumstances, the possibility is there. We don’t fully know what we’re capable of.\nLooking evil and falsehood in the face reminds me of Jesus’ face. That great mystic lady, Julian of Norwich, says that in her visions of Jesus his face was beautiful but it was a mixture that was partly sorrow and partly joy. His face showed he was aware of life’s delight and life’s pain. His face showed he had experience of personal suffering. But it also showed he wasn’t defeated by sorrow. He was still full of life and hope and deep quiet joy. To be truly beautiful is to reflect life’s glory and life’s pain. I’m sure you’ve known people like that? You wouldn’t be afraid to talk to people like that about your own pain and fears.\nWhen I was a young priest in Enniskillen, a lady rang from Derry wanting to come to talk to me. And I thought it was an awful long journey to come to talk to me! So we chatted a while on the phone. She was feeling down about all her faults and failings. So we chatted and I must have confessed some of my own because she ended up saying with great delight, “Sure you’re worse than I am!” It seemed to cheer her up no end! Saved her a long journey too!\nWe need to be blunt and honest in facing all that is evil and wrong in us and the world around us but without losing heart or hope!",""]},{"title":"The Right to Offend?","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, January 25th, 2015","","","A father said to his son: “Find out which way the crowd is moving, son, and then run like hell in the opposite direction!” I think there’s wisdom in that advice and I was reminded of it during these past weeks as we heard of the atrocities in Paris and the ensuing debate about free speech and the media’s ‘right to offend’ Like everyone else, I was shocked and horrified by what the jihadist murderers did. Nothing could ever justify their extreme response to what was written in the newspaper Charlie Hebdo. I had never heard of this paper but the more I do hear of it, the more I’m ‘running like hell’ in the opposite direction from those who justify this paper’s ‘right to offend’ in the name of free speech and free expression in the way they have abused it. Charlie Hebdo describes itself as ‘a silly and rude newspaper’. Most people would have no problem with a silly and rude paper. But Charlie Hebdo is not just silly and rude; it is sick and crude, inflammatory and intentionally vile and blasphemous. The cartoons are often ugly, racist, anti – Semitic, anti-Catholic and especially anti Muslim. I’m sure in the U.K and here they could be prosecuted for “publishing material that is likely to incite religious or racial hatred.” Surely all those people who rightly stood shoulder to shoulder with the people of Paris and France in their time of need and those who wore their “Je suis Charley” badges were not supporting freedom of speech as abused by the Charley Hebdo paper. That kind of abuse could have contributed to the radicalizing of young Muslims and something similar no doubt gave rise to the need for blasphemy laws in former times.","The Irish Times took the view not to republish material likely to be seen by Muslims as ‘gratuitously offensive’ and which would not contribute significantly to advancing or clarifying the debate on the freedom of the press. But then goes on to say the ‘right to offend’ which follows from ‘freedom of expression’ can be defended in other ways. The ‘right to offend’ is a strange concept. Of course every time you open your mouth, every time you put pen to paper you risk offending someone by what you say. At other times, we need the courage to passionately name and confront what we see as evil and wrong, like Jesus did, and take the consequences that may follow for ourselves and certainly did for Jesus.","But that, I feel, is very different from demonizing a whole people like the Jews or a world religion like the Muslims. And, I must confess, it was because I heard some of the disgusting and obscene things said about Jesus and the Trinity, which I won’t repeat here, that I felt I had to speak of this at all! And surely ‘the right to offend’ doesn’t include making the Holocaust a subject of humour or our own Famine? Recently there has rightly been an outcry over the proposed Channel 4 comedy series Hunger, based on our Famine. Surely there has to be some limits to this freedom of expression and this ‘right to offend’?","Yeats wrote, “Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.” Charlie Hebdo tramps on what means everything to millions and millions of people while, at the same time, scolding them for not having a sense of humour!"]},{"title":"Simple Holy Old Fr. Charles","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, Jan 18th, 2015","(We celebrate the feast of St. Charles on Jan.5th. every year. This is an edited version of a letter written by Fr. Wilfred O’Hagan the day after St. Charles was buried in 1893)","“Dear Ada, I received your letter too late to apply the medal to the remains of Fr. Charles but I am sending you something which hundreds of thousands in Ireland would give the world for: the (heart) sign which the old man had on his breast during the time he was lying in the church. I do not know whether it was the sign he wore while alive but I know it is the one he had while lying dead in the church.","All a\nlong I considered Charles a saint but since his death I am sure of it. Such extraordinary crowds were never seen in Mount Argus. The people were from every corner of Ireland. The roads were blocked and it was absolutely impossible to get into the church without long waiting. Sunday evening was the wettest and most disagreeable here that I have seen for a long time. It was quite a Godsend that it was so, or else I am afraid some would have been smothered. Even as it was, the crowds were outside in the rain, still struggling to get in.","The cabmen must have made a fortune. I hardly suppose there is a cab in Dublin that was not at Mount Argus in the last five days. But the cabbies were bent on more than taking fares. Yesterday after he was buried, two cabbies were found at the grave with their horse’s nosebags filled with earth. Of course this cannot be allowed to go on; else we shall have to be making a new grave every day!","The day of the funeral was awful. The Rector wrote to the superintendant of the police for men to keep the crowds back. We had no horse police but rows of helmeted men were overwhelmed by the pressing crowds. Poor old Ireland! There is faith here yet. Even from a point of numbers, the great Parnell’s funeral was inferior to that of the simple holy old Fr. Charles.”","(Good Fr. Wilfrid may have been given to exaggeration with his mention of “hundreds of thousands” ready to give the world for Charles’ heart sign and the 200,000 who attended Parnell’s funeral on 11th October 1891 being inferior to the number who attended the funeral of Charles but it does express his amazement at how well known and loved this simple, holy old man was!)"]},{"title":"The Strawberry of ‘Now’","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 11th January 2015","","I love the old Zen story about a man chased by a tiger. The only escape is over the edge of a cliff where he manages to cling on to a wild vine. He looks up and sees the tiger snarling down at him; he looks down and sees two more waiting for him should he fall. Meanwhile, two white mice appear and begin chewing away on the old vine. He looks to the right and he looks to the left and over to his right, he sees, out of reach, a wild strawberry. And, forgetting the danger from above and below, he stretches out and manages to reach the strawberry. And – so the story goes – it was the most delicious strawberry he’d ever tasted in his whole life!","The old vine is our life being gradually chewed away by time. And aren’t we aware of that at the beginning of a new year? We look back and maybe all we can see is the tiger of the past growling at us; we look forward and all we can see are the tigers of the future waiting to devour us. If only – so the story says – we could let go of the past, face the future with courage and recognise what’s good about the present time and fully enjoy the strawberry of ‘now’!","You may say, “Ah, come off it! Wake up! What’s there to enjoy about now? Couldn’t be worse! What about the universal social charge, the property tax, water charges, suicides, break-ins, hospital trolleys and everything else?” Yes, I know, we can all lament and often do and it can be therapeutic. But just think for a moment. We’ll always find things to complain about, won’t we? Nothing surer! This is earth, not heaven! We had a Director of students who kept telling us, “There are great days coming!” He was thinking of the great new church we were expecting after the Vatican Council! We’re still hoping!","Of course, we must constantly work to improve things; of course. Hope is a virtue we’ll always need. But much can go wrong with our hoping too! We’re always hoping for something better than we have right now, aren’t we? Otherwise we wouldn’t be hoping. But it could be that we have it good right now. This may be as good as it gets – just that we don’t see it. We can be blind or half asleep. Would it not be better to wake up to all that’s good about now instead of hoping for better times in a distant future? The future can just be another trap. And you can be sure, a year from now, we’ll find just as many things to complain about as we do now!","Disillusionment can help us wake up. To be disillusioned was once regarded as a bad thing but is it? If we’re living with illusions, surely it’s a good thing to be rid of them! It’s easy to become disillusioned with politicians, with bankers, with the church and so on – we can manage that quite well. But it’s far harder to recognise the illusions and the expectations we have about our best friend, our family members, mother, father, husband, wife, children or grandchildren. And especially the illusions we have about ourselves!  We build ourselves up for a fall. It’s much easier to keep our illusions. It’s much easier to stay asleep than to wake up.","So, I say to myself and I say to you, “Let’s wake up and enjoy the Strawberry of ‘Now’”"]},{"title":"From Crib to Cross","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, December 21st, 2014","Apollo 8 was the first mission to take humans to the moon and orbit it many times. It was at Christmas time in 1968. The astronauts were Borman, Lovell and Anders. As they orbited the moon they suddenly saw the Earth rising over it just as we see the moon rising over the earth.","Borman, full of awe, said, “O my God! Look at that picture over there. Here’s the earth coming up. Wow isn’t that pretty?” Anders said, “Hey, don’t take that. It’s not scheduled.” Borman laughed and said, “Have you got colour film Jim?” Andres forgot his scruples and said, “Hand me that roll of colour quick, will you? And all Lovell said was “O man that’s great!” And the resulting pictures really were iconic. Every blessed thing is called ‘iconic’ nowadays but these photos really were and are.","The Apollo 8 mission was a spectacular, almost unbelievable engineering triumph but what is most remembered are two things not scheduled at all. One was that photo of the earth rising over the moon. Earth Rise it was called. The other was the famous, moving broadcast that the distant explorers read: “For all the people back on earth, the crew of Apollo 8 has a message we would like to send to you,”  Anders began, “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. And the earth was without form and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep.” And Borman concluded with a sentence clearly spoken by a lonely man 400,000 kilometers from home: “and from the crew of Apollo 8, we close with goodnight, good luck, a merry Christmas – and God bless you all, all of you on the good earth.” It was the most watched TV event in history at that time.","Another photo of planet earth was taken in 1990 by the Voyager 1 spacecraft from a record distance of about 6 billion kilometers. From that distance, it was just a dot, a pale blue dot, a single pixel. This is something of what Carl Sagan wrote about it: “Look again at that dot. That’s here. That’s home. That’s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every “superstar,” every “supreme leader,” every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam”.","","Do we all need to be shipped out into space before we will come to love and appreciate the ‘good earth’ and learn to live in harmony with all peoples and all living creatures that share the planet with us? This Christmas may God bless all of us on this Good Earth!",""]},{"title":"The Joy of our Faith","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, 14th December 2014","","Saturday, at home long ago, was the day for the garden. My father would cut the grass, trim the hedges, and plant the vegetables. When my brother and I were very small we wanted to be doing what he was doing (later we didn’t want to know!), but we were too small and were only getting in the way. But, do you know what he sometimes did? He tied strings to the handles of the wheelbarrow and I held on to one and my brother held on to the other and we were delighted. We were involved in the work and we were delighted! Of course, it was many years before I saw this as a powerful image of our great creator God, who involves us in the work of creation, who shares his creative energies with us. All the power is coming from him but he involves us. The great Thomas Aquinas says that in any making or creating, we are participating in the creative energy of God and it is one of the times we are most like God.","","He also said, “God is an artist and the universe is God’s work of art.” Master Eckhart, who follows Aquinas, says our energy and work come from the heart of God; the divine presence in us is very fruitful. This idea of God’s presence within us, in our hearts, occurs in many spiritual traditions. The Upanishads of India have a lovely image for this: “In the centre of our body there is a small shrine in the form of a lotus flower and within can be found a small space. But that little space within our heart is as great as the vast universe because the whole universe is in him and he dwells within our hearts”. And from the other side of the world, Black Elk says, “The heart is a sanctuary at the centre of which is a small space wherein the Great Spirit lives.” And we’re well aware that Jesus said the Kingdom of God is within us. And St. Augustine, in his famous Confession, says, “I was walking a dark and slippery path, searching for you outside myself and failing to find the God of my own heart.”","Dag Hammarskjold, the second Secretary General of the United Nations, was greatly influenced by Eckhart and St. John of the Cross especially John’s definition of faith as being “God’s union with the soul”. He began his second term with these words addressed to himself in his journal: “In that faith which is “God’s union with the soul”, you are one in God and God is wholly in you, just as, for you, He is wholly in all you meet. With this faith, in prayer you descend into yourself to meet him in the steadfastness and light of this union; see that all stand, like yourself, alone before God, that each act is a continuing act of creation – conscious, because you are a human being with human responsibilities, but governed, nevertheless, by the power beyond consciousness which created man. In that faith which is “God’s union with the soul”, everything, therefore, has meaning. So live, then, and so use what has been put into your hand.” (Markings April 10th 1958).","Of course I know that all this evidence of what others said and experienced is useless unless we ourselves experience in some way the great creator God in the depths of our own being and the energy of his spirit in our everyday lives and responsibilities. This faith and trust that our lives have meaning and that everything has meaning can give us deep joy and the strength to stand steadfast in the midst of much darkness.",""]},{"title":"Please Catch My Baby","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, Dec 7th, 2014","These words were recently screamed from the upstairs window of a house on fire in he center of Dublin. And a young neighbour, Mark Furlong, did just that! He caught the precious bundle safely up in his arms, three months old Mila, and what a moment of joy and relief that must have been! Last week an exhausted mother whispered those same words, “Please catch my baby” as she gave birth in a crashed car on a roundabout near Kilkenny city. And a lovely lady called Mae Doyle, out for a quiet troll with her husband, gratefully and joyously did just that! And reassured the mother that all was well, that her baby girl was fine! Mae’s face was still beaming with joy and disbelief as she told the story to the RTE reporter. But there was no one to catch another new born baby thrown eight feet down a storm drain in Sydney. If only that unfortunate and tragic mother had someone in her life or family to catch her child. But, as you know, this fragile little fellow survived many days in the drain and still had enough energy to keep crying for help! This story touched hearts all over the world and no wonder. Small, helpless, dependent, fragile baby, how tough you are! How we underestimate your ability to survive rejection, abandonment, exposure to the elements and still have the energy to cry for life!","Wouldn’t you love to be like Mark or Mae who were there to catch those babies and to share in the tremendous joy of all concerned? Or like the cyclists who rescued the baby in the drain? But no need to fret! We can realize that dream any day of the week. People are falling every day of the week in a hundred different ways. People are falling down through sickness, depression, loneliness, rejection, or feeling they are a burden on their carers or families. So many need to be picked up, reassured, listened to, taken seriously. The appeals just now in the media for help of all kinds are bewildering and overwhelming in their variety.  But there are many ways of breaking someone’s fall that doesn’t cost a euro. It just takes noticing; it just takes awareness and listening. It takes the same heart that responds to a tragedy in far off Sydney to notice and hear a heart breaking much nearer home!","We pray in the opening prayer of mass today that we open our hearts to welcome Jesus and that we rid ourselves of all that prevents us from doing this. How will we know if our welcome is genuine? We’ll know by the way we open our hearts and our arms to welcome someone lost or lonely; we’ll know by how ready we are to give of ourselves and our time to people in need.","We’ll know by how alert we are to cries coming from a dark place!"]},{"title":"We Are The Work of Your Hands","paragraphs":["","From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, November 30th, 2014","","","","Advent again! So soon! I can’t believe it – despite all the Christmas ads on T.V. I can honestly say 2014 has been the fastest and the shortest year of my life. Has it all to do with ageing? Or did the beautiful summer and autumn weather lull us into unawareness of the rapidly passing weeks and months? I can’t call it sleepwalking – more like sleep skating or speeding or like the old pair on the roller coaster that should have gone to Speck Savers! I certainly needed to hear the wake-up call in today’s gospel: “Stay awake because you do not know when the master is coming…if he comes unexpectedly, he must not find you asleep.” I remembered, too, Shakespeare’s poem: “Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore, / So do our minutes hasten to their end.”\nI seem to be doing a lot of remembering and reminiscing recently. I remember as a young priest visiting Holy Cross, Ardoyne, and getting a great welcome. I was surprised because I’d never been based there and wondered how they knew me. But then a great little lady called Rosie Maguire appeared and said, “Of course we know you! Sure we made you, didn’t we, Father?” Then I knew! They were part of a Vocation Guild that prayed for vocations and also did fundraising to support us and our education. And someone had told them they were making new priests! We’re told today in the First Reading from Isaiah that it was God who did the making: “Lord, you are our Father, we the clay, you the potter, we are the work of your hands.” And all through the years, God the Potter is constantly reforming us and remaking us through all our experiences and all the changing circumstances that we couldn’t possibly have anticipated when we started out.\nAn Advent Blessing: May your inner vision be transformed so that you may see more clearly your own journey as a journey of peace, hope and friendship. May your spirit be open and receptive in discovering the will of God for you. May your prayer be that of wisdom, guidance and a deeper understanding of God’s ways for you. May your friendship with God be strong and healthy. May God’s love be a comfort and challenge as you struggle to find your way. May you not be afraid of the questions that press upon your mind and heart. May you welcome the questions and wait patiently for the day when you will have the answers."]},{"title":"Christ The King","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, Nov 23rd, 2014","I’ve always complained about this feast of Christ the King! I know no matter what words we use to try to describe God or God’s relationship with us, they will all be limited and inadequate. You can’t define the divine! The same applies to Jesus and our relationship with him. But some words are better than others. And ‘King’ I feel is a particularly hopeless word to describe Jesus. King of Kings is no better. King of the Universe is an attempt to say something about the cosmic Christ but I doubt if it succeeds. Why use a word when immediately we have to say, “Of course it’s not like any king or kingdom we have ever known or experienced?” I’m beginning to have great sympathy with St. Thomas Aquinas who stopped writing about all these things at age 48. Admittedly he had already written more than most and more brilliantly than most. But he came to regard it all as ‘so much straw’ compared to what he had come to see, which was beyond all human words.","In the new mass prayers there is talk about ‘gaining admittance’ into God’s Kingdom which sounds like getting tickets for Croke Park! Or being privileged to gain admittance to Windsor Castle! Talk like that in no way helps our faith or our hope! It can have the opposite effect. No way do I want an invitation or a ticket if others are left outside! There’s no doubt, too, we in Ireland carry a lot of cultural baggage about kings and kingdoms. Maybe that’s what I’m suffering from?","The gospel today happily saves the day. Jesus our King is hidden in those who are on the fringes of society, those who are hungry and thirsty and those who are in prison. In Jesus’ story, those called to his right hand were serving him without knowing they were: “When did we see you hungry or thirsty?” And were not doing it in the hope of any reward, here or hereafter. They are doing it out of heartfelt care and compassion for fellow human beings.","We used be told in our early days that we were to see God or Jesus in the sick and the poor. But there’s no need for these mental gymnastics! They can be a distraction, preventing us seeing those real, living human beings in front of us. I remember way back then hearing the true story about a Religious Sister working in the hospital. She probably heard the same thing about seeing God in people and she was really shocked one day when a patient complained bitterly, “You don’t care about me at all! You hardly even see me! You’re just using me as your ladder to heaven!” Sick people or people vulnerable in any way, are very sensitive. They know intuitively what’s genuine and what isn’t. Our calling as Christians is to love and care for the real living human beings we encounter every day, those we live with or work with, the sick and the healthy, the bright or the dull.","Christ the King is hiding in them but no need to be too aware of that!"]},{"title":"Please Listen!","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, November 16th, 2014","","","","(I took this photo when images were fading into each other on the T.V. screen the evening Pope Francis was elected. This young girl was listening very intently as he spoke.)","When I was a young priest at the Graan in Enniskillen, I learned an awful lot from the people who came every day for confessions, blessings and chats. One big lesson was the importance of first listening to people and getting some idea of where they were in their life’s journey, the burdens they were carrying, their joys and sorrows.","I remember well the day I welcomed an old woman and was surprised to find she had come the whole way from Omagh, using two buses, one from Omagh to Enniskillen and the other from Enniskillen out to the Graan. So I said to her, “Look, there are people coming here all the time so I’ll arrange with the next person to take you at least the bit into town.” We were three miles out of town and most came by car or bus. She was very happy and said, “Oh thank you, Father, that’s great, that will be a great help.”","When the next man came for confession, I thought I had a really bright idea. It was the old style confession box meaning I couldn’t see the man but he sounded quite normal so when he’d made his confession, I said to him, “You know we normally ask you to say prayers as a penance but this evening I thought I’d ask you to do something practical instead. Is that ok?” When he said it was, I asked was he going into town and he said he was. So I briefly told him about the old woman from Omagh and asked him would he mind giving her a lift into town. As I say, he seemed normal enough up to that point but then he began to stutter and stammer and mutter to himself: “And that’s me penance?” “Well” I said, “Honestly, you don’t have to do it if you don’t want to. I just thought you wouldn’t mind.”","“Well, indeed, I don’t mind, Father,” says he, “I’ll do it, sure, if you want me to, but I think it’s only fair at the same time to tell you that I’m on a bike!” Lucky he did! Or I’d be up for elder abuse! I never forgot that man on the bike and my bright idea that wasn’t so bright! There were an awful lot of things I didn’t know about people and their lives but that didn’t stop me preaching away about all the things I had learned mostly from books. Many good people must have been just as flummoxed as the man on the bike!","There is great wisdom in these words I found somewhere: “When I ask you to listen to me and you start giving advice, you have not done what I asked. When I ask you to listen to me and you begin to tell me why I shouldn’t feel that way, you are trampling on my feelings. When I ask you to listen to me and you feel you have to do something to solve my problem, you have failed me, strange as it may seem. Listen! All I asked was that you listen, not talk or do – just hear me. When you accept as a simple fact that I do feel what I feel, no matter how irrational, then I can quit trying to convince you and get on with understanding what’s behind this irrational feeling. So please listen and just hear me.","”We are just ordinary people but we can help and heal people by listening to them, giving them our full attention and respect and giving them precious time."]},{"title":"Hearts Fluttering","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

He wrote it to his wife before he went into hospital with heart trouble in October 2001. He wrote it in case he didn’t come out again and it would be some consolation to her:","“My dearest Daphne, I write this short letter to try to lessen your pain just now. Going in for this angiogram I had a good idea of the odds. I’ve been feeling these last weeks that my heart is the problem, not the arteries. That being the case, the odds are not in my favour. But I am not worried. Like the last few occasions, you and I, we trusted in God. He has always been with me from my earliest days. He always made the bends on my road easy with plenty of protection. There had to be a good reason for me to leave the comfort and security of a loving family after over thirty happy years and you, my dearest Daphne, were that reason.","As I progressed through life, each stage was better than the last. And the last 35 years with you were the happiest of all. Even today as you come out of Superquinn and look around for me, my heart flutters seeing you. Long or short, your absence was always felt. It is certainly not my wish that you will have to read this letter. Should you have to, read it as a love letter from the depths of my heart. Your loving husband, Gerry.”","Gerry recovered well and so didn’t have to leave the letter for his wife. But some six weeks later, she was taken into hospital herself and it soon emerged there was no hope for her. She was dying. As he sat by her hospital bed one evening, just a few days before she died, she said, “From the first time we started going out together and now after thirty six years together, my heart flutters seeing you coming to meet me.” He couldn’t believe what he was hearing and promised to bring in the letter he had written six weeks before. When all turned out well for him he had hid it away in his bedside locker. But the following day, he brought in the letter. As she read it, he could see her face brighten and her eyes begin to fill up, especially when she came","to the line about his heart fluttering as he saw her coming out of Superquinn and looking around for him. At that time and still, the words of Red Hurley’s song mean a lot to him: “If tomorrow never comes, will she know how much I loved her?”","Gerry is so happy he and Daphne expressed their love for each other while they could.

My mother had snipped a few of my curls. I picked one up and held it close to the fire. The hair was burnt up in a fraction of a second. A terrible grief assailed me; I had learned that I was perishable. What grieved me then? This insecurity of things! And what did I love? Iron! With a plow hitch I believed myself at seven years rich with a treasure incorruptible, everlasting. And then it turned out that what I possessed was just a bit of iron that rusted. At this discovery I threw myself on the lawn and shed the bitterest tears of my existence.” You may think he was a very unusual child. In some ways I suppose he was and he was a lifelong searcher after truth and meaning but there is something of that child and that man in all of us.","Just as extraordinary is this letter written to God also by a young boy. The teacher who gave the children this exercise didn’t expect anything like this: “Dear God, I don’t know if I believe in you anymore. I wake up in the middle of the night and I think about dying and about how it might not be heaven. It might just be nothing forever and ever and ever. I wish I could be sure you are there or not. I can’t help thinking it’s just something people make up to make themselves feel good about dying. But I do hope you are real. I don’t mean to be rude, I just want you to know how I feel. Lots of love, Kevin.”","Again, you may think it unusual that a young child should have thoughts like these. But I think many children have similar questions and never ask them or did ask them and got nowhere. I certainly thought more about death when I was a child than I do now when I should be thinking about it! That same Jesuit, whose curls were burnt as a child, said late in life almost the same thing as young Kevin: “At the end of the day the only real suffering is doubt. Nothing would be difficult if we could be sure there is a Jesus at the other side.” Of course he knew better than anyone that if we could be sure it wouldn’t be faith and it wouldn’t be hope.","This weekend and all through November we will be remembering our loved ones who have died. Isn’t it strange that despite the many deaths we have experienced in our family or parish and all the funerals we have attended, we can still manage to hide from the reality that I too will die and maybe much sooner than I think. In that light, the death of a close friend or family member is like their last gift to us. Their going can wake us up to the reality that life is not a forever thing but a precious gift, something to make the most of while we can.","Our faith in Jesus and his promise of eternal life can help us in this work. At the time of death, of course, in the rawness of grief, it doesn’t help that much. It can seem so remote. But it is deeply consoling that even Jesus who had no doubt about life after death was still deeply moved – moved to tears – by the deaths of friends and strangers alike.","That same Jesus will be waiting to welcome us on the other side!"]},{"title":"Waiting For Jesus","paragraphs":["","from the desk of Fr.Ignatius Waters C.P.","Sunday October 26th 2014","Today’s second reading talks about how we are waiting for Jesus to return and during the week Luke’s gospel reminded us many times how important it is to be ready for his coming. Our time to meet Jesus could be any day, any time, and that need not alarm us so long as we’re ready. It would be no harm, in fact it could be very good to sit down some day and write down your own spiritual bucket list. If you knew you were going to die tomorrow or next week what things would you want to get done immediately? What things have you kept postponing, thinking you’ll have plenty of time? This light hearted poem expresses joy and gratitude for a real and fruitful life and the readiness to meet Jesus anytime – that much easier, I suppose, when you’ve had a long and fruitful life.\nLast night I dreamt I got such a fright, I looked in the mirror and, Lord, what a sight. I was hairless and toothless with a terrible cough And, even in sleep, I could still feel the shock.\nHimself, he came home and his face it turned white. He said, “Merciful Lord, what happened my wife? She’s hairless and toothless with a terrible cough.” I said, “Look in the mirror, and don’t die of fright.”\nSo we both looked together and laughed at the sight And we thought of our youth and that beautiful night When we danced till the stars had gone from the sky And we made that sweet promise to love till we die.\nWe stood there together and pondered a while And talked of the joy at the birth of each child, How each one gave love in their own special way And we said a wee prayer God would guide them each day.\nSo now here we are, hairless, toothless and old, But we have each other, to have and to hold, And now we can say, “O, it turned out alright – The choice that we made on that beautiful night!”\n(Written by shy parishioner LLLC.)"]},{"title":"Mission Sunday","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, October 19th, 2014","You never miss your mother till she’s gone! An old saying but so true about so many things and situations! You never miss your children till they’ve emigrated. You never miss your teeth till they’ve also emigrated. You never miss your hearing or your eyesight till they’re gone or nearly gone – and when they’re gone, they’re gone, as the ad says!","The same can be said about the whole of our lives. Where did our lives go so quickly? Children and young people are so preoccupied with school and studies, with being a success and living up to own their expectations and the expectations of others, that they have little time to wonder what the whole thing is about. Adults are so preoccupied with work and making a living, caring for children and anxious about their own parents, that they too have little time to reflect much about life itself! What is it all about? What is my reason for living? It can happen that we begin to seriously wonder about all this only when we’re approaching the departure lounge!","There are people who say, “I don’t believe in God any more but I miss him – or her!” and people who say, “I believe in God but not in the church.” And people have their reasons for each of these statements. But maybe they’ve never been able to articulate clearly what has led them to these conclusions. It can be one bad experience of church or church people. It can be that God and church can seem so remote from their everyday lives. The ideals of Christianity can seem impossibly high and they feel overwhelmed by them instead of encouraged.","But when faith and hope in God or church are gone, they need not be gone forever! People may at some stage want to re-engage but don’t know how. The local church may be so depleted in numbers and energy that it doesn’t know how to reach out to the many good people who just feel lost and confused but no one has come looking for them. The Legion of Mary does its best but recruits are few and the harvest is so great. There are many who call themselves Catholic but all it means is that they were baptized and received First Communion; they come to the church for weddings or funerals; they may have their children baptized but they never think of joining with others for Sunday Mass. Those who do pray and go to mass know very well it’s still a struggle to go on believing and hoping and living a truly Christian life. What must it be like without the constant nourishment of the Eucharist and the support and encouragement of the other believers? We know well that communion is not a reward for a well spent life. It is spiritual nourishment for us frail mortals without which we cannot live a Christian life.","Pope Francis has said the situation today is the mirror opposite of Jesus’ parable about the shepherd who leaves the 99 sheep to go looking for the one that is lost. “Today” he says, “We have one in the sheepfold and 99 we need to go looking for.” That’s why he urges us all, wherever we are, to be missionaries of God’s love, tenderness and mercy.   As well as being Mission Sunday, today is also the feast day of St. Paul of the Cross who said towards the end of his life that if he was starting out again, he would preach nothing only the mercy and compassion of God for all people.","",""]},{"title":"Laughter in the Midst of Tears","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, October 12th, 2014","Dublin children were precocious long before the advent of smart phones and iPads. That’s if we’re to believe the old story about two little girls sitting outside the apartments. One says to the other: “Rita, there’s a condom on the veranda!” And Rita replies, “Janey, what’s a veranda?” We need to laugh, don’t we, as much as we need to eat or drink or breathe fresh air? I’ve heard of‘Laughter clinics’ in some hospitals designed to help the healing process. And you know how we say, “I had to laugh” as if it was the only sensible thing to do! Or when faced with some shock or problem: “I didn’t know whether I was going to laugh or cry.” Mostly, I suppose, we cry and that’s fine; tears can be healing. But, if we can manage it, laughing is another possibility. It’s just another perspective on our troubles and can open us up to hope!","I don’t need to tell you there’s not much to laugh at in our world. There’s so much that’s evil and awful and so much that’s crazy.  And still I’m expecting you to laugh? I wouldn’t blame you for thinking I’m crazy too! That’s not hard to admit since we’re all foolish in ways. And St.Paul often brags about being a fool for Christ. And we’re almost designed to be crazy, being such a mixture of flesh and spirit, animal and angel, misery and dignity! If we were just flesh, it would be that much easier and if we were all spirit, even easier – or so it seems to us. In any case, I’m not talking about foolish shallow laughter but a deep peaceful kind of joy, rising from confidence and faith in Jesus and his resurrection. Maybe ‘laugh’is not the best word – but it gets you thinking, doesn’t it?","The circus clown is a very good image to explain all this. What is a clown? The word itself is a mixture of clod and cloud – feet very much on the clod, the earth, but head in the clouds! It can mean one who recognises the weakness, the earthiness, the clay of which we are made but who still believes and hopes and dreams and strives for something more, something beyond.","It’s only when we’re tested that we know whether we have real hope or not. It’s easy to have faith and hope and laugh when everything is going fine. But in the clown we see laughter in the midst of tears and tears in the midst of laughter. We don’t find it easy to laugh at ourselves, at all our mistakes and foolishness. But clowns can help us laugh at ourselves in them. They can help us admit what strange creatures we are. We can come to love and accept ourselves in them. They are loveable even though they are far from perfect, even though they mess up in everything! Remember the Muppets?","Clowns can help us believe and hope and never give up! A clown will insist on riding a bicycle with crooked wheels or walking a tightrope that’s not tight at all! We know the poor clod will fall on his face and he does. But he picks himself up, dusts himself off and tries again. Sooner or later, through wit and perseverance, he will succeed and we’re all delighted!

At World Youth Day in Rio last year, to over three million young people, the Pope said, “young hearts want to build a better world.” He invited them to be “protagonists of transformation” and urged them not to be mere “observers of life, but to get involved. Jesus did not remain an observer, but he immersed himself. Don’t be observers, but immerse yourself in the reality of life, as Jesus did.”","We all know heroic young people who are getting involved in the messiness of life – helping the young; the weak, the elderly, the vulnerable – and putting the needs of others above their own. In this year’s Message for Day for Life, the Bishops of Ireland, Scotland, England & Wales would like to follow in the footsteps of Pope Francis and invite everyone to get involved in caring for, nurturing and protecting life at every stage and in every condition. To young people especially we want to say “#Livelife!” from its beginning to its natural end.","In a ‘throwaway’ culture, it is easy for life to be undervalued. Last year, Donal Walsh, an extraordinary 16-year-old from Kerry in Ireland, suffering from terminal cancer, taught us how to value every second of life and to show gratitude for all that we can so easily take for granted. Donal had “wanted to live, to play for Munster, to travel the whole world to raise children and die when I’m 100” and instead of reacting with anger and despair at the news of his cancer, he embraced life to promote his anti-suicide #Livelife message. He wrote and spoke widely in the media about young people and suicide – urging teenagers to “appreciate what you have, know that there are always other options and help is always there”. His #Livelife message has touched many hearts and changed lives.","Every one of us, young and old alike can play our part in the promotion of life. Our every thought, word or action can promote or extinguish life – we all have a valuable contribution to make.","Pope Francis tells us that being a protector of life is about, “protecting all creation, the beauty of the created world. It means respecting each of God’s creatures and respecting the environment in which we live” The Pope speaks of “protecting people, showing loving concern for each and every person, especially children, the elderly, those in need, who are often the last we think about.” He emphasises the importance of the family, “husbands and wives first protect one another, and then, as parents, they care for their children, and children themselves, in time, protect their parents.” And of caring for society by “building sincere friendships in which we protect one another in trust, respect, and goodness. In the end, everything has been entrusted to our protection, and all of us are responsible for it.”","","Let’s all be builders of a better world and protect life"]},{"title":"Perpetual Distractions","paragraphs":["Thought on Sunday","from the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters C.P.","Sunday 21st September 2014","","","What’s the point of having a ‘Thought on Sunday’ when it’s so quickly forgotten? Do you remember last Sunday’s thought? Probably not! And I probably would have forgotten it as well if I hadn’t come across a lovely story from the Hindu tradition that confirms my concluding remarks last week. And they were, “Our life journeys are different but, like Christy Dignam, all of us need to be shaken up and wakened up in some way!”","Here’s the story. God and a man are walking down the road. The man asks God: “What is the world like?” God answers: “I’d like to tell youbut my throat is parched. I need a cup of cold water. Please get me a cup of cold waterand I’ll tell you what the world is like.” The man heads off to the nearest house to ask for a cup of cold water. He knocks on the door and it is opened by a beautiful young woman. He asks for the water but she answers, “I’ll gladly get it for you but it’s lunch time. Why not first come in and have lunch? He does.","Thirty years later, they’ve had five children; he’s a respected merchant andshe’s highly respected and loved in the whole community. They’re in their house one evening whena hurricane hits the whole area. The man cries out, “Help me God!”  And a voice comes from the centre of the hurricane: “Where’s my cup of cold water?”","As with all parables, it’s better you reflecton it yourself. What does it say about the human condition? What does it say about our relationship with God? Here are a few thoughts to get you started. It seems that being human means we are constantly distracted. It’s not that we’re constantly aware of what’s really important in life but occasionally get distracted. No. It’s that we’re so preoccupied with the ordinary business of living that it takes a hurricane of some kind (like Christy Dignam’s cancer) for real awareness to break through. C.S. Lewis put it this way: “God is always speaking to us, but normally we’re not aware; we’re not listening.” So some kind of hurricane is needed!","Also, despite the hurricane, the story is essentially consoling. Even the hurricane has a loving intent. To wake us up! And if God asks for his cup of cold water only every thirty years, that’s not very demanding, is it? Remember Jesus said that as long as we give it to one of his brothers or sisters, we give it to him. And he did constantly remind us of the need to wake up to spiritual realities, at the same time reassuring us that God loves and understands us and is ever ready to forgive us. He understands our nature better than we do. He knows we get involved and absorbed in many things. So God must be more like loving parents or grandparents gazing on their children at a family gathering, happy they have full lives that absorb them and not demanding their constant attention.","I know not all parents or grandparents are like this!  But God is!"]},{"title":"Horrible but Holy","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr.

How did this instrument of death become an instrument of life? How are we healed by wounds? Jesus’ wounds and our own? Seems crazy, doesn’t it? But this is how it works.                                                                                                                        We recently had the gospel about Peter almost drowning and when I read it, I remembered a line, “Only drowning men can see him,” and I wondered, “Where did that come from?” I guessed it wasn’t from a psalm, maybe a poem or a song? And good old Google came to my help: “And Jesus was a sailor/ When he walked upon the water/And when he knew for certain/ Only drowning men could see him, He said, “All men will be sailors then/ Until the sea shall free them.”","It’s a Leonard Cohen song and it seemed to describe so well what was going on with Peter the sailor, the tough one, the strong one, the impetuous one: “If Jesus the carpenter can walk on the water, Peter the Fisherman can do it as well!” And when he found he couldn’t, that he was going under, drowning, he reached out, cried out, for the help he needed all the time but didn’t see it! And Jesus put his hand out, held him and steadied him. It was a whole new experience for Peter. It took ‘almost drowning’ to help him see Jesus in a whole new way and allow Jesus to help him.","Many of you, I’m sure, have heard of Christy Dignam from Finglas, founder of the band Aslan, whose great hit was ‘Crazy World’. He was diagnosed with a rare type of cancer a year ago and given a very short time to live. I heard a brutally honest interview with him. Maybe you heard it too? Song writer that he is, he was eloquent in describing how the ‘almost drowning’ helped him come to see what was important in life and what wasn’t. And also what faith in God meant to him. “It’s all you have!” When Christy Dignam tried heroin, it was the first time since he was six that he felt normal. That’s because when he was six, he was brutally raped. “Something like that leaves a gaping hole in you,” he said. And when he stopped taking heroin, the hole soon re-opened. “Then I forgave the bloke who did it to me. That was a huge part of the process. It was like I was walking around with him on my shoulders all my life. And then he just lifted off my shoulders in that moment when I said I forgave him. And I did forgive him, because I meant it.”","And he ended the long interview with these words:”When I got cancer, that’s when I decided to look at all the things in my past in an honest way. When you get to a situation like cancer, there is no bullshit any more. Cancer is the real McCoy. Nothing is more real than it. So I could be honest with myself for the first time in my life. I used to be honest on a head level but not down in my heart. This might sound strange but cancer is the best thing that has ever happened to me, because I have always wanted to be honest with myself. It left me with the real me.”","Our life journeys are different but, like Christy Dignam, all of us need to be shaken up and wakened up in some way!","It’s how we look at Jesus’ cross and our own cross that makes the difference.

It may interest you to know that my daughter was married in the “W.C.” and it was there that she met her husband.  I can remember the rush there was for seats.  There were ten people to a seat usually occupied by one.  It was wonderful to see the expression on their faces. The newest addition is a bell donated by a wealthy resident of the district.  It rings every time a person enters.   A bazaar is to be held to provide plush seats for all since the people feel that it is a long felt need.  My wife is rather delicate so she can’t attend regularly.  It is almost a year since she went last.  Naturally, it pains her very much not to be able to go more often.” Yours sincerely,  etc.","Don’t tell anyone about this or ‘yours sincerely’ may be in trouble!",""]},{"title":"Passionists of St. Patrick’s Province","paragraphs":["Saint Paul of the Cross lived all his life in Italy, but he always had a special interest in “England and the neighbouring kingdoms” and he prayed continuously for these lands. His desire to see his community established there came to pass in 1841 when Father (now Blessed) Dominic Barberi established a Passionist community at Stone in Staffordshire.","Fr Dominic brought the ministry of the Passionists to Ireland in 1848. He preached the first Passionist Mission in Dublin at Saint Audeon’s, High Street together with Father Ignatius Spencer and his early companions. Fr Ignatius preached the first Passionist Mission in Scotland at Saint Andrew’s, Glasgow, in 1850.","The first Passionist monastery (or ‘Retreats’ as the Founder called them) was opened in Ireland at Mount Argus, Dublin in 1856, and in Scotland at Saint Mungo’s, Glasgow in 1865. Other Retreats were soon set up across the two countries as well as in England and Wales. In the 1970s the Province took over responsibility for the English speaking parish in Paris at St Joseph’s, Avenue Hoche, which the Passionists had founded in 1863.","In 1952, the Province took on responsibility for the missionary Church in Bechuanaland (now Botswana), and soon developed in South Africa as well. Today, the Passionists in southern Africa developed by St. Patrick’s Province thrive in these countries as well as in Zambia and are moving ever closer to autonomy.","At the present time the Passionists of St. Patrick’s Province have communities, and also run parishes, at Mount Argus in Dublin; St. Mungo’s in Glasgow; Holy Cross, Ardoyne in Belfast; and St. Joseph’s in Paris; as well as a Retreat Centre at Tobar Mhuire, Crossgar in Co.

Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, June 29th, 2014","“Everything that happens is something to be adored!”","I came across this quotation from Leon Bloy long years ago when I was a student.  I think it was from a book called ‘The Woman who was poor’. It sounded exaggerated and all wrong then and it still does, but there is a deep truth here.  God can and does bring good from everything, even from evil. “All things work together unto good”, says St. Paul and he was speaking from his own experience.  St. Augustine added to this, “even our sins”: “All things, even our sins work together unto good.” And he, too, was speaking from his own experience!","Karl Rahner expresses the same idea like this: “Each moment of our lives is like a grain of sand lying by the side of the ocean of infinity. Every event, no matter how negative or sinful, is a potential experience of God.  God is not tied down to the overtly religious or sacred.  In fact, the experience of God does not normally take place at ‘holy’ times.  In reality we can recognise the presence of the absolute mystery in church events, only if we have already greeted and welcomed that presence in the happenings of each day, particularly in the hurtful and negative ones.”","But quoting what other people have said doesn’t help us much.  We need to experience this in our own lives.  Then it comes alive for us!  Then we can accept the truth of it.  Grace intervenes often at the moment of our greatest separation from God, when we least expect or deserve it.  Just to show that it is grace!","Think of the conversion experiences of Peter and Paul.  They weren’t praying or on retreat when grace struck.  Peter was cursing and swearing that he didn’t know this man, Jesus, and Paul was breathing out threats to slaughter the followers of Jesus!","This is how Paul Tillich describes what happens: “Grace strikes when we walk through the dark valley of an empty and meaningless life…when year after year, the longed for perfection does not appear, when the old compulsions rage within us as they have for decades, when despair destroys all joy and courage.  Sometimes, at that moment, a ray of light breaks into our darkness, and it is as though a voice were saying, ‘You are accepted, accepted by that which is greater than you, and the name of which you do not know.  Do not ask for the name now; perhaps you will find it later.  Do not do anything now; perhaps later you will do much. Simply accept the fact that you are accepted.’ If and when that happens to us, we experience grace.”\nWe just need the courage to accept this – the courage to accept acceptance!","Oscar Wilde sums up all this in a very ordinary way:","“Every saint has a past; every sinner has a future!”"]},{"title":"Eat My Flesh, Drink my Blood","paragraphs":["","From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday, June 22nd, 2014","I don’t like having to read the gospel about eating flesh and drinking blood. It sounds sick. But it’s important to remember that St. John is recalling after a very long time the sense of what Jesus said – not his exact words. Even so, it’s hard to take! And John tells us those who first heard it found it hard to take, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat? What kind of talk is this?” But Jews then should have been able to get the sense of it better than people today. Why? Because every day they were sacrificing animals in the temple and then eating the flesh of the sacrificed animal as a way of becoming part of God, a way of sharing in the life and power of God. And this is what Jesus wanted to do in a whole new way. And there is a deep beautiful meaning in this the more we grasp it!","During retreats in South Africa, we usually had communion under both species – bread and wine – and I usually warned the people to beware of the possibility of a fly in the chalice. Well, this led one girl to have her best insight of the whole retreat which she talked about publicly. When she looked in the chalice, instead of a fly she saw her own reflection. There she was in the blood of Christ! And this led her to reflect that she had become one with Jesus, part of Jesus, part of God. Just like Augustine explained! When we take normal food and drink it becomes part of us but when we take the body and blood of Jesus it’s the exact opposite! We become part of Jesus. I know it’s all a great and beautiful mystery and we say that at every mass when the drop of water is added to the wine: “By the mystery of this water and wine may we came to share in the divinity of Christ who humbled himself to share in our humanity.” That says it all. We are the drop of water, lost in, and drowned in the divinity of Jesus. What a marvelous destiny! Of course I’m not always aware of it. We get so used to mass, so used to communion.","The simplest way of understanding it is maybe the story of the young ocean fish. This young fish was swimming around everywhere looking for the ocean and couldn’t find it. Then he decided to consult an old fish. He said to the old fish, “You’re much older and more experienced than I am. Could you please tell me, where is the ocean? I’m looking for the ocean!” And the old fish was very surprised and said, “But it’s here! This is it! You’re in it. It’s all around you! You couldn’t survive without it!” And the young fish was very disappointed and he said, “Ah no, this is just water! I’m looking for the ocean!” And he swam away still looking for the ocean.","We are in God like the fish is in the ocean; like the drop of water in the wine. We couldn’t exist without him.

Because deep down I knew there was every danger I could melt and my name being ‘Waters’ and with my vivid imagination, I could imagine myself melting so much that I might flow out under the door!","It took me years and years to see and accept that I didn’t need to be ashamed or embarrassed about being overcome and moved to tears by the beauty and magnificence of creation, by the mysteries of nature, by the beauty of great singing and music, by stories of birth and death and family relationships. The mystery of the Trinity today shows us relationships are there even at the heart of God.","It took me even longer to see and understand that when there’s a welling up in us like that, it’s the deep heart’s response to God’s Spirit at work in the heart of all creation. A moment of deep insight came for Jesuit priest and scientist, Teilhard de Chardin, when he came to see that all becoming and developing in an expanding universe is the divine drive of the Holy Spirit. Not just in people but in the living natural world as well. And he prayed like this:","“Lord Jesus I love you, who are as gentle as the human heart, as fiery as the forces of nature, as intimate as life itself, you in whom I can melt away. I love you as the world, as this world that has captivated my heart; and it is you, I now realise, that people even those who do not believe, sense and see through the magic immensities of the universe.”","Now I don’t pray like that every day and I’m sure you don’t either but we do respond like that. We respond instinctively and intuitively to the wonders of creation like the stars at night and the wonders of life like the birth of a child and we don’t know where it’s coming from and we wouldn’t be able to put it into words. And we maybe think we’ll be regarded as foolish if we try! But these are the things the theologians and mystics are saying all the time but they use such awkward and difficult language that we don’t recognise it. But we do know these things. We too have experienced these things. But probably we didn’t link them very much with God or with God’s Spirit. I heard an American bishop say once, “When we sing ‘Alleluia’, it’s a holy Wow! I resisted saying ‘Wow!’ for years because I saw it as yet another American import but now I’m ‘wowing’ all over the place!","You may remember a poem and a song, years ago, called ‘Desiderata’? People loved it so much they had it framed. Some of the words were these:","“You are a child of the Universe, No less than the trees and the stars;","You have a right to be here. And whether or nor it is clear to you,","No doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.”","People loved this poem because it touched a deep chord in their hearts. And to be in touch with our hearts is to be in touch with the heart of the Universe and the heart of the divine creator. And I’m sure that’s why indigenous peoples all over the world put so much trust in the drum as their instrument of prayer. The drumbeat speaks the beat of the heart, not just the human heart but the heart of the universe and the heart of the Creator. The purpose of all prayer and contemplation is to return to this heart.","So keep in touch with your own heart. Don’t be afraid of all that wells up from your heart and often expresses itself in tears. They are a gift, thought I didn’t always believe this.","Tears are telling us things too deep for words.",""]},{"title":"Come,Holy Spirit","paragraphs":["From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters CP","Sunday 8th June 2014","An Undertaker once put this ad in a newspaper: “Why go round half dead when we can bury you for a few hundred Euros?” And one Sunday when Fr. Frank announced that I was away being creative, what one young girl heard was that I was away being cremated! And we might as well be away being buried or cremated if we are not constantly being renewed and refreshed, constantly being filled with new spirit, heart and hope. That’s the work of God’s Holy Spirit in us. The following is a modern psalm praying for that:","","Comfortable and well worn are my daily paths,","whose edges have grown grey with constant use","My daily speech is a collection of old words worn down at heels by repeated use.","My language and deeds, addicted to habit, prefer the taste of old wine,","the feel of weathered skin.","Come and awaken me, Spirit of the new.","Come and refresh me, Creator of green life.","Come and inspire me, Risen Son,","you who make all things new","I am too young to be dead, to be stagnant in spirit.","High are the walls that guard the old.","the tried and secure ways of yesterday","that protect me from the dreaded plague, the feared heresy of change","For all change is a danger to the trusted order,","the threadbare traditions that are maintained by the narrow ruts of rituals.","Yet how can an everlastingly new covenant retain its freshness and vitality","without injections of the new, the daring and untried?","Come, you who are ever new, wrap my heart in new skin,","ever flexible to be reformed by your Spirit.","Set my feet to fresh paths this day:","inspire me to speak original and life-giving words","and to creatively give shape to the new.","Come and teach me how to dance with delight","whenever you send a new melody my way."]},{"title":"Hide and seek","paragraphs":["","From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday 1st June 2014","Then Jesus was taken up, and a cloud hid him from their sight. (Acts 1:9)","Did you ever play ‘Hide and Seek’? It was once a favourite children’s game and it didn’t cost a penny! I’ve come to see that ‘Hide and Seek’ can teach us much about our relationship with God. There’s a story about a father playing ‘Hide and Seek’ with his little son. He couldn’t get the little lad to understand that he shouldn’t shout “Ready!” when he found a good hiding place. That he was making it too easy to find him. But it took the father some time to understand that, from the young lad’s point of view, getting found was the best part! He wanted to be found. He delighted in being found! Master Eckhart (1260 – 1328) understood this very well when he said, “God is like someone who clears his throat loudly while hiding and so gives himself away.” Like that little boy, God’s greatest joy in hiding is also in being found. Too often we associate the hiddenness of God with fear, with a sense of remoteness and inaccessibility. We overlook the playfulness involved. God’s hiding is rooted above all in compassion. God hides to gently draw us to himself.","In the Jewish tradition there’s a very different story of ‘Hide and Seek’. A little boy comes running to his father crying inconsolably. Between big sobs, he manages to say, “Dad, I’ve been playing hide and seek with the other children. It came my turn to hide but after I found a good place in the woods I sat there for hours waiting for someone to find me. But no one came! They left me there alone! His father held him and hugged him and said, “Ah, my son, that’s how it is with God too. God is always hiding, hoping that people will come looking for him. But no one wants to play. He’s always left alone wanting to be found.” This simple story expresses well the mystery of God’s great compassion, wanting so much to draw us to himself. But we often draw back in fear, slow to believe in a God of hidden glory and surprised to find ourselves lovingly sought after by this hidden God.\nThe third story is about a little girl and her favourite trick in ‘Hide and Seek’ was to pretend to run away and hide. She would tell her Dad to close his eyes and start counting. She would then pretend to run away but immediately came sneaking back to stand right beside him while he was still counting with his eyes shut tight. She breathed as silently as she could, standing inches away. And then she’d squeal with delight when he opened his eyes and found her right there beside him. This wasn’t ‘Hide and Seek’ at all. She was breaking all the rules! But the father loved her version of the game, loved pretending he didn’t know she was there, and loved her delight in surprising him. God for him to this day is his seven year old daughter, slipping back across the grass, wanting once again to surprise him with a presence closer than he ever expected.","The 14th.Century mystic who wrote the ‘Cloud of Unknowing’ knew God hides from those he cherishes to increase their longing to find him and he said, “We must break through that thick cloud with longing love.”"]},{"title":"The Ordinary is Extraordinary","paragraphs":["","A Thought on Sunday","The Ordinary is Extraordinary","From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday 24th May 2014","When I was about fourteen years of age, I read George Eliot’s “Mill on the Floss” and I remember savouring it, the story and the language, and for the first time appreciating what real literature was. And I wrote down some of the lines in a notebook which I still have. They spoke to me then and they speak to me now. In fact, they speak to me now with a new intensity as I rediscover my childhood delight in the earth and nature:","“We could never have loved the earth so much if we had no childhood in it – if it were not the earth where the same flowers come up every spring that we used to gather with our tiny fingers as we sat lisping to ourselves on the grass – the same hips and haws on the autumn hedgerows – the same redbreasts that we used to call “God’s birds” because they did no harm to the precious crops. What novelty is worth that sweet monotony where everything is known and loved because it is known.”","We are now moving into the weeks when the Irish countryside is at its most beautiful. We have thousands and thousands of miles of hawthorn hedges that erupt at this time into the greatest floral display our landscape knows. And the real beauty of the season is that it reaches its peak as the furze comes into its great summer-flowering. A beauty that hasn’t been much captured by poet or artist! And why I don’t know. Is it because the hawthorn is so ordinary, so familiar, that we don’t even notice it very much?","Our motorways have not only speeded our journeys up and down and across the country but they’ve also revealed this May paradise reaching the horizons on every side. It looks like the whole thing was carefully planned but it’s rarely remarked upon. You would think it should be promoted as a tourist attraction. But then you would probably need small planes or helicopters to view it all. Doing so from cars could be as dangerous and distracting as the mobile phones – appreciate and admire but not while driving!","There’s a radio ad from the Mater Private telling us our hearts beat 100,000 times a day but if they begin to wobble or complain, the Mater Private will be delighted to help us! Imagine 100,000 times a day for eighty, ninety or even a hundred years! What a marvel that is. And just as marvelous if we can see and hear and walk and breathe deeply for all the years.","But it can happen that we only become aware of the wonder of it all when there’s a wobble or a breakdown. I think I’ll adjust George Elliot’s words like this: What novelty is worth the sweet monotony where everything is known and loved and keeps working all the years!” Or in the words of Psalm 39:","“I thank you, Lord, for the wonder of my being, for the wonders of all your creation” and especially for the hawthorn!"]},{"title":"17th Century Nun’s Prayer","paragraphs":["","A Thought on Sunday\n17th Century Nun’s Prayer\nfrom the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, CP","Sunday 18th May 2014","In the Baroque period (1600 – 1750 approx.) the liturgy used to include what was called the ‘risus paschalis’, the Easter laughter. The Easter homily had to contain a story which would make people laugh, so that the church resounded with joyful laughter. I learned that from Pope Benedict. He thought it beautiful and appropriate that joyful laughter become yet another symbol of Easter. This, of course, is not shallow surface laughter but a deep genuine joy flowing from our faith and hope in the Risen Lord. The following prayer will hardly send you into joyful laughter but may give rise to a quiet smile at how real and practical it is and a realisation of how little human nature changes over all the centuries:","Lord, Thou knowest better than I know myself that I am growing older and someday will be old. Keep me from the fatal habit of thinking that I must say something on every subject and on every occasion. Release me from the craving to straighten out everybody’s affairs. Make me thoughtful but not moody; helpful but not bossy. With my vast store of wisdom, it seems a pity not to use it all but thou knowest, Lord, that I want a few friends at the end. Keep my mind free from then recital of endless details; give me wings to get to the point.","Seal my lips on my aches and pains. They are increasing and love of rehearsing them is becoming sweeter as the years go by. I dare not ask for grace enough to enjoy the tales of other’s pains, but help me to endure them with patience.","I dare not ask for improved memory but for a growing humility and lessening cock sureness when my memory seems to clash with the memories of others. Teach me the glorious lesson that occasionally I may be mistaken. Keep me reasonably sweet; I do not want to be a saint; some of them are so hard to live with. But a sour old person is one of the crowning works of the devil. Give me the ability to see the good things in unexpected places and talents in unexpected people. And, give me, O Lord, the grace to tell them so.","Amen"]},{"title":"World Day of Prayer for Vocations","paragraphs":["","A Thought on Sunday","World Day of Prayer for Vocations","from the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters CP","Sunday, May 11th 2013","The theme of this year’s Vocations Sunday is “Vocations, Witness to the Truth”. This is Pope Francis’s first message for Vocations Sunday, as last’s year’s message had been written by Pope Benedict before he retired. Fr. Paul Francis has brought together these extracts:","Every vocation, even within the variety of paths, always requires an exodus from oneself in order to centre one’s life on Christ and on his Gospel. Both in married life and in the forms of religious consecration, as well as in priestly life, we must surmount the ways of thinking and acting that do not conform to the will of God. It is an “exodus that leads us on a journey of adoration of the Lord and of service to him in our brothers and sisters”","Therefore, we are all called to adore Christ in our hearts (1 Pet 3:15) in order to allow ourselves to be touched by the impulse of grace contained in the seed of the word, which must grow in us and be transformed into concrete service to our neighbour. We need not be afraid: God follows the work of his hands with passion and skill in every phase of life. He never abandons us! He has the fulfilment of his plan for us at heart, and yet he wishes to achieve it with our consent and cooperation.","Today too, Jesus lives and walks along the paths of ordinary life in order to draw near to everyone, beginning with the least, and to heal us of our infirmities and illnesses. I turn now to those who are well disposed to listen to the voice of Christ that rings out in the Church and to understand what their own vocation is. I invite you to listen to and follow Jesus and to allow yourselves to be transformed interiorly by his words, which “are spirit and life”Jn. 6:62.","A vocation is a fruit that ripens in a well cultivated field of mutual love that becomes mutual service, in the context of an authentic ecclesial life. No vocation is born of itself or lives for itself. A vocation flows from the heart of God and blossoms in the good soil of faithful people, in the experience of fraternal love. Did not Jesus say: “By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another” (Jn 13:35)?","The true joy of those who are called consists in believing and experiencing that he, the Lord, is faithful, and that with him we can walk, be disciples and witnesses of God’s love, open our hearts to great ideals, to great things…. I ask you bishops, priests, religious, Christian communities and families to orient vocational pastoral planning in this direction, by accompanying young people on pathways of holiness which, because they are personal, “call for a genuine ‘training in holiness’ capable of being adapted to every person’s need” (here Pope Francis is quoting from Saint John Paul II’s Letter, “At the Beginning of the New Millennium”, n. 31).","Let us dispose our hearts therefore to being “good soil”, by listening, receiving and living out the word, and thus bearing fruit. The more we unite ourselves to Jesus through prayer, Sacred Scripture, the Eucharist, the Sacraments celebrated and lived in the Church and in fraternity, the more there will grow in us the joy of cooperating with God in the service of the Kingdom of mercy and truth, of justice and peace. And the harvest will be plentiful, proportionate to the grace we have meekly welcomed into our lives."]},{"title":"There Is No Night","paragraphs":["","A Thought on Sunday","There Is No Night","from the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters CP","Sunday 4th May 2014","Jimmy McCarthy, composer of so many songs including ‘No Frontiers’ and ‘Wonder Child’, has written a new one which he calls ‘There is no night.” When asked by Sean O’Rourke last week how long it took to write it, he said he’s been writing it all his life. There’s been a lot of depression and darkness in his life but he’s come to see it’s all just a preparation for the dawning of day:","The more I know, the more I wonder\nFrom the setting of the sun\nTo the dawning of the day\nAnd the questions to be asked\nAre beyond number.\nOnly this much for certain I can say\nThere is no night, but longing for the day.","In the song, he asks where is the warm place to keep him from the cold and where are his children to give him life when he is old? He’s been a dreamer and a wonderer by trade but has found little and learned so little. As a builder of bridges to the beyond, it’s the same story. He’s found little except this: “Only this much can I say for certain: “There is no night but longing for the day.”","But this is a very deep learning. Intended or not, this is Easter learning. This is an Easter song. And has echoes of what is happening in the lovely story in today’s gospel. The two disciples tramping home the whole seven miles to Emmaus were exhausted, depressed, in a very dark place. Probably not much chat. Probably they feel their hearts will never again be warmed by hope. “We had hoped he was the one that would save Israel.” But Jesus is dead. The dream is dead. Maybe it was foolish to hope?","When Jesus joined them on the road, he opened their minds and hearts to see and understand that it had to be this way; that there was meaning in all that had happened. It was necessary for Christ to suffer before entering into his glory. That’s what Moses and the prophets had been saying all along. As they listen, their hope begins to flicker into life again until they are able to say, “Were not our hearts burning within us as he explained the scriptures to us.”","And because their hearts are changed, everything is changed. They are filled with a whole new energy; it’s no problem at all to walk back the whole seven miles to Jerusalem. In fact, it’s the only thing to do! They almost have to! They have to share the good news! And imagine the joyful chat on that return journey!","All is changed because their hearts are changed. And their hearts are changed by the power of the word they have heard on the road. They had been nourished by the word of God. And nourished, too, by the body of Jesus broken for them and the blood of Jesus poured out for them in the Eucharist.","The Eucharist has the power to do the same for us!"]},{"title":"The Joy of Easter","paragraphs":["","A Thought on Sunday","The Joy of Easter","From the desk of Fr.

So he’s really saying, “Look, there is the lamb to be sacrificed in the future!” How did John, so early on, see so clearly what was to come?","When Jesus at the Last Supper says, “This is my body given for you, this is my blood poured out for you,” we should feel as bad, as disturbed, and as uncomfortable as Aimee with the sandwiches! I can’t eat this! I can’t take this! This is too much! It’s just we’re so used to hearing about eating the Lamb of God and drinking his blood that it doesn’t horrify us as it did the first disciples.","Years ago, lads in love, starry eyed and carried away, used declare, “You’re so gorgeous, I could eat you!” And they thought they were paying a compliment! Of course they want to eat you like they devour a good meal but they never thought of offering themselves to be eaten! Did they? Like Jesus did? But, with Jesus, needless to say, it’s a completely different kind of eating. There is no language that can explain it. When we eat the Lamb of God we become part of what we eat. We become part of God. We become part of the mystery that God is! At every mass we say, “By the mystery of this water and wine may we come to share in the divinity of Christ who humbled himself to share in our humanity”.","Just now, we are entering into Holy Week when the Good Shepherd becomes the Lamb of God.

Ignatius Waters, CP","Sunday 23rd March 2014","","St. Charles never worried about himself and because of that he just kept going till he was near to collapse at times! And because of that, others tried to plan little breaks for him which rarely worked out as intended! You remember the same thing happened to Jesus when he tried to plan a break for himself and his disciples in a quiet place.","In the summer of 1860, Fr. Charles was invited by a man called Mr. Jordan to visit Glendalough. But he didn’t get on a bike and cycle there like Fr. Herman, though he was only 39 years of age at the time. Nor did he go by car! No, he travelled by train to Rathdrum with Mr. Jordan. He probably thought he was going to have a quiet relaxing day in the country. But can you imagine his shock when at Rathdrum station they were met by a very large crowd of people and a band! I’d love to know what tunes the band played! Maybe some marching tunes that might have reminded Charles of his short time in the army – though he didn’t like to be reminded of that! By the time they reached Laragh, more and more people had joined them. How word went round before mobiles and texting I don’t know. But the Parish Priest invited him to the church which must have been St. Kevin’s in Laragh. He spoke very simply and sincerely to the people gathered there and then blessed them all. The sick and infirm had been brought by carts and cars from the surrounding villages and districts and were gathered outside the church. Only after all that did Charles get a chance to visit the ruins of Glendalough. And then it was back to the train at Rathdrum, back to Dublin and back to Mount Argus!","At that time (summer of 1860) Charles was only about 3 years in Mount Argus. He arrived in Mount Argus on the 9th July 1857, the feast of Our Lady of Holy Hope. If, after only three years in Ireland, Charles was so well known, is it any wonder Fr. Wilfred could say at his funeral: “I suppose there is not a single man or woman in Ireland that has not heard of him.” And I’ve discovered that Charles also made it to Killarney in 1875. Why, I don’t know. One morning he celebrated mass in the Presentation Convent and the chapel couldn’t hold all that came to that mass. Afterwards he visited the Sisters of Mercy. I gave a retreat in that convent but didn’t know Charles had been there a hundred years before me! And at that convent there was a repetition of what had happened at Glendalough. People flocked in from the countryside in all kinds of traps and carts and cars. They had to use a field attached to the convent where Charles prayed with them and blessed them.","But what really surprised me more than anything was that Charles also visited my home town of Navan. I didn’t know that! And it was on a weekday, according to a book published in July of 1893, the year Charles died. “Hearing that he was among them the people thronged to the church and after addressing the large crowd, he blessed them.” And that was it! I don’t know why he was there, how he got there, how long he was there – just that he was there! Also I met a family in Arklow whose grandfather, James Murphy, was given a little cross by Fr. Charles because James took up a collection among the fishermen to help with the building of Mount Argus. And that cross has been treasured in the family ever since! Which shows that James knew, even then, that there was something special about this man! This old book has helped me see that Charles, shy and humble though he was, was out and about among the people of Ireland more than I knew.

Whether they’re inside us or outside of us in our relationships, our families, in our work situation or in all the complexities of life today. This devotion may have been inspired by the words of Saint Irenaeus who said: ”Eve, by her disobedience, tied the knot of disgrace for the human race; whereas Mary, by her obedience, undid it”.","An image of Mary, Undoer of Knots, was painted in oils on wood by Johan Scnmidtner and it hangs in the church of St. Peter in Augsburg in Germany. It shows Mary untying the knots on a long white ribbon. It seems the ribbon was used at the wedding of a noble couple in the 17th Century and the marriage, in danger of breaking up, was saved through Mary’s intercession. A nephew of the couple commissioned the painting. But we would probably not have heard of it had not Fr. Jorge Bergoglio (now Pope Francis) come across it at a time when he was in great turmoil himself; a time when he desperately needed Mary’s help in untying the many knots in his own life.","Everyone has times like this in life and we need the wisdom to recognize this and the humility to ask for the help we need."]},{"title":"You Have Been Seduced!","paragraphs":["","A Thought on Sunday","You Have Been Seduced!\n\nfrom the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, CP","Sunday 9th March 2014","In the Gospel reading for Ash Wednesday, we’re told three times not to do things to be noticed – your almsgiving, your prayer or your fasting. Three times we’re told do all in secret and your heavenly Father who sees all that is done in secret will reward you. Jesus is saying, “Don’t be a hypocrite playing the part, putting on a great show to impress others!” You’re wasting your time. You may be a brilliant actor but this is not about acting. This is about being real in your relationship with God and with others. So don’t be putting on a gloomy look. Look bright and cheerful. Wash your face. Put on the perfume or the make-up if you need it! Doesn’t this show you how real and good humoured Jesus was? And what do we do? We put on ashes!","And to think that this good sinless one experienced what it’s like to be sin, to feel separated, forsaken and abandoned by the God he loved with all his heart. I’ve met many good people who feel so depressed and despairing and full of guilt that they can’t believe they’re loved by God or forgiven by God. No matter what you say it doesn’t get through. They can’t receive it! Imagine Jesus having to experience that same kind of nightmarish black darkness and aloneness. And all to convince us of God’s closeness to us in our searching and our struggles!","I say these things to you because I know you understand these things. You who take time to read the bulletin or the ‘Thought on Sunday’ have a relationship with God and Jesus. Otherwise you wouldn’t be bothered! And you know what it’s like when there’s any kind of breakdown in that relationship. You mightn’t be able to explain why it means so much to you but it does. Maybe the words of Jeremiah the prophet will help. You remember at first Jeremiah didn’t want to be a prophet, “I’m too young, don’t ask me, I wouldn’t know how to be a prophet, I wouldn’t know what to say!” But he fell in love (no other word for it!) with the living God. Even though it cost him so much trouble and abuse, he couldn’t deny it! This is how he explained it: “You have seduced me O God, and I let myself be seduced. You have overpowered me; you were the stronger. I am a daily laughing stock, everybody’s but. The Word of God has meant for me insult, derision, all the day long. I used to say, ‘I will not speak his name any more!’ But there seemed to be a fire burning in my heart, imprisoned in my bones. The effort to restrain it wearied me. I could not bear it!”","In other words, I couldn’t deny it. I couldn’t keep it in. I had to tell people about it! Our relationship with God is a love story, a love affair. We’ve been seduced and I hope we’re happy to be seduced! Even though like all real relationships it can be terrible as well as great, painful as well as joyful, heartbreaking as well as heartwarming!"]},{"title":"He’s Not Your Son","paragraphs":["","A Thought on Sunday","He’s Not Your Son","from the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters C.P.","Sunday 23rd February 2014","Two men were good friends. Every so often they had good chats. They had much in common including being the fathers of sons. One had a son who had real problems. Despite bringing him to psychologists and other experts there was little improvement in his behavior. They were constantly bailing him out of trouble, constantly returning things he had stolen and doing all they could to keep him out of jail.","The friend had been hearing these stories over all the years and one day, well aware of the risk he was taking, he said, “I know it’s none of my business but to tell you the truth, if he was my son I’d have sent him packing years ago!” And the father of the lad agreed, “If he was your son, I’d have sent him packing years ago too! But he’s not your son! He’s mine!","","“ The friend meant well. He had great sympathy for the father of this very difficult son. But despite his firm declaration, he can’t be that sure what he would do in a similar situation. It is so necessary to see this. That wedon’t know! There’s so much we don’t know until we’re in the situation ourselves. There’s so much we don’t know even about those close to us, our families, our friends, those we work with. And even when people try to tell us things, we don’t know it as they know it! This shouldn’t surprise us since, a lot of the time, we don’t know or understand ourselves either! The attitudes, the fears we picked up early in life are still influencing us in the ways we think and act. So we certainly can’t claim to know what others are feeling or experiencing! We can guess at it but that’s about all. Yet we say things like “Don’t talk! I’ve been through it myself – I know all about it!” We don’t! And worse still if we not only diagnose what’s wrong with others but start suggesting the remedies as well: “What you need to do is this!”","I remember one day in South Africa a young priest came in from Mass very annoyed and saying: “I studied for eight years and these people think they know more than I do!” And I’m sure he wasn’t helped when I said, “But they do! These people do know far more than you do – not from books maybe but from life!” And about same time I heard a really old priest say: “It’s so important to be kind to people because you never know for sure where they’re coming from, what they’re going through, what hurts from the past they carry. You never know for sure!” And Thomas Merton said if we could see each person as he or she really is, we would bow down before them!","I know what you’re thinking now! Instead of being so smart, I should have bowed down before that young priest! But after all I’ve said here, I shouldn’t be claiming to know what you’re thinking. Should I?"]},{"title":"Clear the ground for new growth","paragraphs":["A Thought on Sunday","Clear The Ground For New Growth","From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday 16th February 2014","We’re already well into February and I haven’t even begun on my good, sincerely made resolutions to visit old friends around the country while I’m still able and while they’re still around! In the meantime a friend sent me these five points. Instead of doing more ‘right things’, they point to first preparing the ground by getting rid of the ‘wrong things’ we’re already doing. These five points are very close to the gospel today.\n1. Stop holding grudges. – Don’t live your life with hate in your heart. You will end up hurting yourself as much as the people you hate. Forgiveness is not saying, “What you did to me is okay.” It is saying, “I’m not going to let what you did to me ruin my happiness forever.” Forgiveness is the answer! Let go and you’ll find peace and freedom. And remember, forgiveness is not just for other people. It’s for you too! Forgive yourself, move on and try to do better next time.","2. Stop berating yourself for old mistakes. – We may love the wrong person and cry about the wrong things, but no matter how things go wrong, one thing is for sure, mistakes help us find the person and things that are right for us. We all make mistakes, have struggles, and regret things in our past. But you are not your mistakes, you are not your struggles, and you are here NOW with the power to shape your day and your future.\n3. Stop spending time with the wrong people. – Life is too short to spend time with people who are constantly draining you of energy. If someone wants you in their life, they’ll make room for you. You shouldn’t have to fight for a spot. And remember, it’s not the people that stand by your side when you’re at your best, but the ones who stand beside you when you’re at your worst that are your true friends.","4. Stop trying to be someone you’re not. – One of the greatest challenges in life is being yourself in a world that’s trying to make you like everyone else. Someone will always be prettier, someone will always be smarter, someone will always be younger, but they will never be you. Don’t change so people will like you. Be yourself and the right people will love the ‘real’ you.","5. Stop being ungrateful. – No matter how good or bad you have it, wake up each day thankful for your life. Instead of thinking about what you’re missing, try thinking about what you have, that so many are missing. And of course, if you’re struggling with any of these points, know that you are not alone. Many of us are right there with you, working hard to feel better, think more clearly, and keep our lives on track."]},{"title":"Pause a While and Smile","paragraphs":["","A Thought on Sunday","Pause for a While and Smile","From the desk of Fr.

Ignatius Waters","Sunday 2nd February 2014","This weekend we are celebrating St. Brigid and what used be called Candlemas, celebrating the light Christ brought to the world. Brigid is also linked with light. At sunrise on the first day of February, her birthday, a column of fire rose from her infant head, according to the ancient story, and neighbours saw the house aflame from earth to heaven. But when they entered the house to rescue her, there was no fire!","I’ve always loved sitting around a blazing fire, telling stories and reminiscing. The years I was in Wicklow l often lit the fire. There’s plenty of work with a fire, as you know, and cleaning it out afterwards. But it’s well worth it! I remember as a child how I loved sitting in the chimney corner of an old thatched house up a long lane near home. A brother and sister lived there and he was like an African from the smoke and the soot. When he became ill, they took him off to the hospital and what was the first thing they did? They washed him! It nearly killed him! They washed off all his protective layers! This love of sitting around fires must come from a deep ancient memory in us of the central place fire had for our ancestors. For them the hearth, the fireplace, was the centre of the house. As recently as the seventeenth century, Irish dwellings were focussed on a central fire and the family slept round the fire, their feet facing it. This fire, essential to survival in the winter and to cooking all year round was regarded as a spiritual gift, blessing the whole house. Fire was alive! It was ‘great company’ people used say down in Wicklow. Fire was mysterious as were mountains and water gurgling up from the earth in wells, and the great sun rising in the east and descending in the west. These natural wonders were mysterious and sacred and close to people’s everyday lives and work.","Long before Christianity there was a Goddess Brigid linked to the sun’s daily circling of the earth, and to the fire and fireplaces in the homes. And Christianity very wisely blessed and baptised what was good in the old religions, showing reverence for holy wells and sacred mountains like Croagh Patrick. And St. Brigid took on many of the qualities of the Goddess. St. Broccan in the 7th century described St. Brigid as “an excellent woman and a golden flame.” Her name meant power, strength and vigour. When the woman of the house fixed the fire at night, she then closed her eyes, stretched out her hands and prayed, “I cover this fire as noble Christ did, Mary on top of the house and St. Brigid in its centre.” The St. Brigid’s Cross was a pre Christian sun wheel representing the sun’s daily journey, again wisely adopted by Christianity. And it wasn’t difficult to do because for us and in the scriptures, fire and water and wind are symbols of the Holy Spirit. Remember the flames of fire descending at Pentecost bringing energy and power. We are baptised in God’s spirit, the breath of life. We can’t live without water and breath and energy.","It’s hardly surprising then that Irish Water and massive pylons touch such deep emotions in us! It’s a job for St. Brigid! But I doubt if they’ll call her in!"]},{"title":"The Mystery of the Moon","paragraphs":["","A Thought on Sunday","The Mystery of the Moon","from the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters CP","Sunday, January 26th 2013","In the meetings of cardinals that preceded the election of Pope Francis, each cardinal was allowed five minutes to speak on what kind of church and what kind of pope was needed at this time. Cardinal Bergoglio (as he was then) made a few points in about three minutes. One was about the ‘mystery of the moon’. The moon gives light at night but the moon doesn’t produce the light or own the light. It simply reflects the light of the sun. Similarly the church reflects the light of Christ. So the church mustn’t fool itself into thinking it produces the light or owns the light. The church is there to reflect the light of Jesus. It is there to tell the world the good news about Jesus.","This reminded me of a story I heard about a lecturer in Greece who after his talk asked, “Any questions?” and someone, half in earnest, half in joke asked, “Could you tell us what’s it all about? What’s the meaning of life?” and people laughed at the impossibility of the question. But the lecturer put up his hand for silence and said, “I’ll tell you.”","He took out his wallet and from it removed a small round mirror. Then he explained: “When I was a small child during World War 2, we were very poor and lived in a remote village. One day on the road, I found the broken pieces of a mirror. A German motorcycle had been wrecked in that place. I tried to find all the pieces and put them together but it was impossible. So I kept the largest piece. This is it. And by scratching it on a stone, I made it round. I began to play with it as a toy and became fascinated by the fact that I could reflect light into dark places where the sun’s light could never reach. It became a game for me to get light into the most inaccessible places where the sun could never shine.","I kept this little mirror, and as I grew up, I grew to understand that this was not just a child’s game but was something I could do with my life. I came to understand that I am not the source of the light. But light – be it truth or understanding or knowledge – is there and it will only shine in dark places if I reflect it. I am a small fragment of a mirror whose whole design and shape I don’t know. Still with what I have I can reflect light into the dark places of this world and into the dark places in human hearts. Perhaps others, seeing it, will do the same. That’s what I’m about. That’s the meaning of my life!”","In that simple story we see what Jesus is setting out to do in today’s gospel; we see the whole purpose of the church and we see our own vocation as Christians. To reflect that light, we need to rediscover for ourselves the joy of knowing Jesus and the good news he brings and the difference it makes. Then we’ll be eager to find ways of sharing it with others.","The people that lived in darkness have seen a great light!"]},{"title":"Migrant Sunday 2014","paragraphs":["","A Thought on Sunday","Migrant Sunday","from the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters C.P.","Sunday 19th January 2014","Today is Migrant Sunday\nand if anyone should have understanding of those who are migrants in our country we should, because we have been migrants, and still are, in countries all over the world. But I feel we’re so bewildered and disoriented ourselves by the rapidity of the changes that have engulfed us that we may have little energy to engage with or reach out to the migrants in our midst. You expect migrants to be disoriented in a new and different culture. But it’s possible we’re just as disoriented ourselves without moving anywhere! And we get little chance to stand back and ask, “How have we coped, how are we coping with all the changes, with much that has bewildered and shocked us over the years? The country at one moment awash with money and tiger confidence, then awash with austerity and cutbacks, recession and depression! And now? Maybe a little more hope. But we still see so many having to emigrate to find work; so many young people killing themselves; so many horrific murders even in the last week. And when most ordinary people are worried about mortgages, property tax and impending water charges, there’s another class, a class apart, enjoying top – ups on top wages! It’s sickening! Not to mention the water consultants! Is it any wonder we might be disoriented? And not even know it? All our energy is put into trying to keep afloat, trying to keep our heads, trying to keep some kind of faith and hope! In his book, ‘Walking on Water’ Fr. Michael Heher says this:","“The church is going through what everybody on earth is going through. The real overarching issue of our times is that the way of life we have lived for centuries is ending; societies across the globe are all in various states of fragmentation. One of the largest migrations in the history of the planet is taking place; already 120 million people live in countries where they were not born. Few of us live in the same world we were “given” at birth. Whatever it may turn out to be can’t be seen yet. So far the experience has been almost entirely one of dislocation. It’s about the experience of being disoriented. It may get expressed in ways theological and psychological, but it is primarily a cultural phenomenon.”","Needless to say, this is too huge a subject for one page. But could our dislocation and disorientation lead in strange ways to the realisation of God’s dream for us? God’s dream and Jesus’ dream is that we might be one, all the peoples of the earth seeing themselves as migrants and pilgrims, asking questions, seeking answers together? Questions unite – answers so often divide!","The Focolare Movement, founded by Chiara Lubich, grew from that dream. These are her words: “It brings together, like a real family, people of different languages, races, cultures, nations and also faiths, because besides being made up of Christians of different Churches, there are also followers of various religions and people who do not have a religious faith at all, but who share with the others great human values such as justice, solidarity, peace, and human rights.”","It’s a dream worth dreaming and working towards, isn’t it? So let’s pray today that our own struggles and disorientation may help us be more understanding and less ready to criticise those who are different from us. And that we may be truly open to dialogue with other Christians, other world religions and people with no faith at all."]},{"title":"Only Hope of Meeting","paragraphs":["","A Thought on Sunday","Only Hope Of Meeting","From the desk of Fr. Ignatius Waters, cp","Sunday 12th January 2014","Since we had the Feast of St. Charles on Jan 5th I would like to share with you some of his constant themes in the letters he wrote to his family. Two things struck me very strongly. The first was how deeply he loved his family and remembered every one of them in the letters. But after joining the Passionists, he never saw them again and never met the younger members at all. To us, Holland seems very near. Not like Australia or the States! Why did he never visit his family at some stage? Why did none of them visit him? The second was how he keeps repeating his hope of meeting them all again in heaven.","When he was only 32, he wrote to his brothers and sisters, “Although we may never see each other again in this world, we must never lose hope of meeting once more in heaven.” When he was 37 he wrote something very similar. “Every day I pray for you all during Mass: being so far away from my own home, I can only hope that we will meet again in heaven.” When he was 41 he wrote to his brother, Fr. Peter Joseph: “I have been away from you for 17 years; this time has passed so quickly that to me it seems but a moment. But what does it matter how far we are from each other in this life, so long as we are united for all eternity with Jesus and Mary. We should be thankful to God for giving us such good parents. I now find it quite difficult to write and speak in my own native tongue. Here in Dublin we have built a huge monastery, which cost about eight thousand pounds. The Irish gave us the money; they are very generous when it comes to their Catholic faith.”","When he was 51, he wrote to that same brother, “I wish you all a happy and holy New Year, one full of happiness and peace. May the Lord keep you safe from every evil of soul and body and when this life is over, may he lead you to that blessed place where the years do not end and happiness and peace are eternal.”","When he was 54, he sent Christmas greetings and said this, “The birth of our Lord Jesus Christ in the stable at Bethlehem is a mystery, a miracle so great, full of such humility and love, that it will fill the angels and saints with wonder for all eternity.”","When he was 62, his priest brother died and he wrote expressing his grief. Many members of his family died over the years and he couldn’t be there – he received the news in letters. When he was 65, he wrote to his brothers and sisters encouraging them to pray to Our Blessed Lady for the gift of perseverance in prayer and the gift of a happy death. And he concludes the letter: “Our separation will not last long. We will meet again in heaven; that is what we must hope for.”","When he was 66, he wrote to his family, “I am an old man now and am afraid of death. I pray every day that through the powerful intercession of his mother, God in his mercy will grant me a happy death. 60 members of the Passionist Order have died in Ireland and England since I came over here from Belgium.”","When he was 69 he wrote to his sister, “In the past six weeks, two of the Religious in this monastery have died. I’m afraid I will die soon; in your kindness, pray for me that the good God will give me a happy death and a favourable judgement. Our separation will not last much longer. Let us hope that we will meet again in heaven.” He wrote his last letter in the middle of December 1892, around the time of his 71st birthday and just a few weeks before his death when he again asks for prayers and sends them his blessing – his last blessing.","At the beginning of a New Year, we can learn from Charles how short our lives are “so that we may gain wisdom of heart.” And learn also to appreciate our families, our friends and all those who encourage us along the way!"]}]
